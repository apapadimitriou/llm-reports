    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies and structural contradictions that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The most glaring issue is the report's claim to be written in June 2025 while citing sources accessed in September 2025, creating an impossible temporal framework. The report repeatedly refers to Q1 2025 and Q2 2025 as historical periods while simultaneously treating them as forward-looking, demonstrating complete temporal confusion. Additionally, there are significant contradictions between narrative claims and data presentation - the executive summary states the price target is based on June 16, 2025 data, yet multiple sections reference future events as if they were past performance. The financial projections table shows 2025 as an estimate while the text discusses Q1 2025 results as actual. The report also contains numerous unresolved tensions between bullish fundamental claims about AI investments and bearish valuation conclusions, with insufficient connective reasoning to reconcile these opposing viewpoints. While individual sections show technical competence, the overall document reads as internally inconsistent and temporally impossible.",
