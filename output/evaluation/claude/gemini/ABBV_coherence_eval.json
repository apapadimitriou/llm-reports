    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "This AbbVie report demonstrates a clear overall structure and adequate language clarity, but suffers from significant temporal inconsistencies and unresolved contradictions that prevent a higher rating. The report is dated May 12, 2025, yet contains numerous references to future dates throughout 2025 as if they were projections, creating fundamental temporal confusion. For example, the ESG section cites Sustainalytics data \"as of Feb/Aug 2025\" while the Morningstar source shows \"data as of 2025-08-11\" - dates that postdate the report's own publication date. The Bulls/Bears section presents competing viewpoints but fails to reconcile how the \"immense and durable free cash flow\" claim aligns with Bears' concerns about the $70 billion debt burden constraining financial flexibility. Additionally, the sources section contains problematic citations, including Reddit posts and Wikipedia entries that undermine credibility, alongside legitimate financial sources. While individual sections like the DCF valuation methodology are well-explained and the immunology transition narrative is coherent, these temporal inaccuracies and unaddressed contradictions significantly impair the report's internal consistency and reliability.",
