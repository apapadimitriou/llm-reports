{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report explicitly states key assumptions with specific figures (WACC 9.2%, terminal growth 4.0%, revenue CAGRs by year) and provides clear location in tables. However, justification is weak - WACC components lack sourcing beyond 'market volatility,' revenue growth rates have minimal historical context, and operating margin assumptions lack peer benchmarks. Specificity is solid with clear units, timeframes, and drivers. Internal consistency shows minor issues - EPS data shows 'Insufficient data' for FY2022A creating gaps, and some forward P/E calculations don't fully reconcile. Most critically, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis despite acknowledging 'Very High Uncertainty' - only qualitative risk discussions are provided. This absence of scenarios/sensitivities caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rule.",
