    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some causal reasoning and explicit assumptions but falls short of rigorous analytical depth. Causal explanations exist but are often shallow: \"Results were driven by continued momentum in the Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) segment\" and \"NII was $14.6B, driven by higher yielding assets.\" The model includes explicit assumptions like \"mid-cycle ROTCE of 18.5%\" and \"cost of equity of 10.5%\" but these lack proper benchmarking or industry context. While the report mentions potential scenarios (\"If Fed cuts rates, NIM could compress\"), it provides no quantified sensitivity analysis. The valuation assumptions appear in isolation without stress testing: \"terminal growth rate of 3.0%\" and \"five-year revenue CAGR of approximately 4.0%\" are stated without ranges or alternative scenarios. Counterpoints are mentioned generically (\"macroeconomic headwinds\") but not explored quantitatively. The implications remain vague rather than providing specific, conditional guidance for different market conditions.",
