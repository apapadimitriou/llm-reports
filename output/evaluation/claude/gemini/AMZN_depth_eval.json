    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates some analytical depth but falls short of rigorous quantitative analysis. It provides basic causal explanations like \"North America segment's operating margin expanded by 190 basis points to 7.5%\" due to \"operational efficiency initiatives\" and \"AWS growth is not constrained by a loss of demand but rather by physical capacity limitations.\" The DCF model includes explicit assumptions (\"WACC of 10.3%,\" \"5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 9.5%,\" \"Terminal Growth Rate 3.0%\") but these lack benchmarking or sensitivity analysis. While counterpoints are mentioned (\">$100 billion capex plan will significantly dampen free cash flow\"), they remain largely descriptive without quantified scenarios. The report states \"If Fed cuts rates\" scenarios but provides no specific impact ranges. Missing are stress tests like \"if capex increases 20%, FCF impact = X\" or \"base/bear/bull case valuations.\" The analysis acknowledges uncertainty but doesn't translate this into actionable, conditional investment implications with quantified ranges.",
