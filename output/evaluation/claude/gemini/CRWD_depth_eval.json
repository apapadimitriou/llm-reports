    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits some causal mechanisms and explicit assumptions but lacks sufficient benchmarking, quantified sensitivity analysis, and robust scenario testing. The analysis provides causal explanations like \"NII was $14.6B, driven by higher yielding assets\" and \"operating costs grow slower than revenue due to scale,\" but many assumptions remain unsupported. The DCF model includes explicit assumptions (\"19.5% 5Y Revenue CAGR,\" \"WACC: 8.9%,\" \"terminal growth rate of 3.5%\") but these lack industry benchmarks or stress testing. The scenario analysis is superficial, showing bull/bear cases without exploring probability distributions or detailed sensitivity ranges. While the report identifies \"elongated sales cycles\" as a post-outage impact and notes \"GAAP loss from operations widened dramatically to $(113.0) million,\" it fails to quantify the range of potential outcomes or provide decision-relevant thresholds. The competitive analysis mentions threats but doesn't model their quantitative impact on market share or pricing power.",
