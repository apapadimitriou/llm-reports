    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit key assumptions with specific figures (WACC 9.8%, terminal growth 4.0%, revenue CAGR 11.5%, operating margins expanding to 59.5%). Most assumptions are clearly stated and proximal to forecasts. However, justification is weak to partial - the WACC components lack proper sourcing (risk-free rate and ERP cited but not clearly linked to specific dates/sources), and revenue growth drivers rely heavily on qualitative descriptions rather than quantified historical benchmarks. The report shows good specificity with units and timeframes but has minor internal inconsistencies. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers, only qualitative risk discussions. This absence of stress-testing caps the grade at Fair despite the explicit nature of most assumptions.",
