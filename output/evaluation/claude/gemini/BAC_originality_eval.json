    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some company-specific analysis but is predominantly composed of generic banking insights and boilerplate phrasing. While it contains one weak synthesis linking BAC's asset-sensitive balance sheet to NII growth potential under elevated rates, most insights are standard restatements about capital strength, deposit franchise advantages, and macro sensitivity that could apply to any major bank. The valuation section relies on conventional DCF and P/TBV multiples without novel drivers. Key red flags include extensive use of generic phrases like 'fortress balance sheet,' 'scale advantages,' and 'responsible growth' framework descriptions. The CRE stress acknowledgment and specific dividend increase details provide some company relevance, but insufficient original analysis to warrant a higher grade.",
