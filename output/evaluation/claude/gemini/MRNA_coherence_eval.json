    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that render it incoherent as a unified investment argument. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet dumps with minimal transitions, particularly the Pipeline Deep Dive and Risk Assessment which present information in list format without connecting themes. The report contains numerous unresolved contradictions: it claims \"aggressive cost-cutting\" is reducing expenses by 40% year-over-year while simultaneously stating the breakeven target moved from 2026 to 2028, contradicting the narrative that cost reductions are effective. The valuation section presents a detailed SOTP analysis yielding $26 per share but provides no clear bridge between the financial forecasts showing profitability in 2027 and the pipeline assumptions. Temporal claims are consistently inaccurate, with the report treating Q2 2025 events as current when written in September 2025, and describing \"recent\" FDA approval of mNEXSPIKE without proper temporal context. The extensive citation system (47 sources) creates more confusion than clarity, often failing to support the specific claims made. The Bulls/Bears section lists contradictory points without reconciling them with the base-case valuation narrative.",
    "evidence": [
        "\"On a cash basis, operating expenses were reduced by 40% year-over-year\" contradicts \"breakeven target that has been pushed out by two years to 2028\" without explanation (Company Overview vs Investment Thesis sections)",
        "Pipeline Deep Dive and Risk Assessment sections present bullet-point lists with minimal connective tissue between subsections",
        "Report consistently refers to Q2 2025 results as recent/current despite September 2025 writing date, creating temporal confusion throughout"
