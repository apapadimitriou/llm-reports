    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across all major sections with appropriate depth and sector-specific content. All expected sections are present including analyst note, business description, strategy, bulls/bears, economic moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, financials, and ESG. The financials snapshot includes key pharma metrics (revenue, operating margins, EPS, ROIC, free cash flow) with multi-year history and forecasts. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (Skyrizi/Rinvoq growth, margin expansion) to DCF assumptions and fair value outcome. Evidence citations are comprehensive with 39 numbered sources consistently referenced throughout. However, the report lacks peer benchmarking analysis and scenario/sensitivity analysis around key assumptions, preventing an 'Excellent' rating. Some minor redundancy exists with Humira decline mentioned across multiple sections without adding new depth.",
