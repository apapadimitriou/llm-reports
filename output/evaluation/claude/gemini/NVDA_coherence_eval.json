    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from multiple critical coherence failures that severely undermine its credibility. Most egregiously, it contains impossible temporal claims throughout - citing earnings results from August 2025 while the report is dated July 15, 2025, and referencing events like 'recent reversal of H20 export ban' without any credible sourcing. The narrative is riddled with contradictions: claiming 'insatiable demand' while simultaneously modeling dramatic growth deceleration from 54% to 5%, and describing Bears' concerns about high valuation (40x P/E) while using different multiples (32x) in valuation without reconciliation. The financial table shows nonsensical data including negative EPS of $2.9 in FY2025 alongside claims of exceptional profitability. Sections read like disconnected bullet points with minimal transitions, particularly the Bulls/Bears section which fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base case. The extensive source list appears fabricated, containing impossible future dates and non-existent articles. These fundamental flaws in temporal accuracy, internal consistency, and factual grounding make the report incoherent and unreliable.",
