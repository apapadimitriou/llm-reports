    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates some company-specific analysis but falls short of providing truly original insights. While it attempts synthesis around the Stress Capital Buffer reduction and strategic transformation, most insights remain generic to large bank turnaround stories. The report contains substantial copied/paraphrased content from earnings releases and press materials, with phrases like 'crown jewel of the franchise' and extensive financial table reproductions. The valuation section relies on standard P/TBV methodology without novel drivers. Despite some attempt at connecting SCB reduction to capital returns, the analysis lacks the quantified mechanisms, specific catalysts, and unique angles needed for higher grades. The report reads more like a comprehensive summary of public information rather than original research.",
