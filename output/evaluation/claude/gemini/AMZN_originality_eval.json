    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some company-specific analysis but falls short of providing substantial original insights. While it synthesizes AWS capacity constraints with capital expenditure strategy and identifies the retail profitability inflection from fulfillment network optimization, most content consists of earnings recaps and generic strategic commentary. The valuation section relies on standard DCF methodology without novel drivers or mechanisms. Key insights like the 'narrative disconnect' between market reaction and fundamentals show analytical thinking but lack quantified implications or specific catalysts. The report contains significant boilerplate phrasing ('customer obsession,' 'wide economic moat') and generic competitive analysis that could apply to any large tech company.",
