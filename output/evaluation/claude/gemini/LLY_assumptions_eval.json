    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet basic assumption quality standards across all five pillars. Key DCF assumptions lack explicit justification\u2014the 37% 2025 revenue growth, 45% peak operating margins, 3% terminal growth, and 7.3% WACC are stated without supporting evidence, history, or peer benchmarks. Critical assumptions like revenue growth deceleration rates and margin compression timing are completely opaque. The report contains a material contradiction: it claims consensus 2025 revenue of $61.71B but models 37% growth from 2024's $45.04B base, which would yield $61.9B, creating unexplained inconsistency. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers despite acknowledging significant risks around pricing pressure, competition, and manufacturing execution. The DCF methodology is mentioned but key assumptions remain black-box, making the $650 target unauditable and unconvincing.",
