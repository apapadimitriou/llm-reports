    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it presents extensive data and some causal statements like \"NII was $14.6B, driven by higher yielding assets\" and \"AI as a Moat Enhancer,\" it lacks explicit quantified assumptions, benchmarked parameters, or meaningful sensitivity analysis. The DCF model mentions \"WACC of 8.5%\" and \"Terminal Growth Rate...3.5%\" but provides no benchmarking, ranges, or stress testing of these critical assumptions. The report states \"100 bp cut lowers NIM ~20 bps\" type analysis is absent. Counterpoints are mentioned superficially (\"Bear Case\" section) but not quantified or explored with scenarios. The extensive citations and data compilation cannot compensate for the fundamental absence of rigorous analytical mechanisms, assumption testing, or decision-relevant sensitivity analysis that would demonstrate true analytical depth.",
