    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies and multiple contradictions that fundamentally undermine its coherence. Most critically, the report claims to be written before Q2 2025 earnings yet repeatedly cites Q2 2025 actual results, earnings call transcripts, and specific financial data throughout the analysis. The Executive Summary states it 'awaits greater clarity from the upcoming Q2 2025 earnings release' while the Financial Analysis section provides detailed Q2 2025 actual figures. The report also contains numerous unexplained data gaps in key financial tables, with many cells marked as unavailable despite claiming comprehensive analysis. Additionally, there are contradictory valuation claims - the DCF section states it 'yields a fair value estimate of approximately $59.00' but the summary table shows a DCF range of $57.00-$61.00. The peer comparison table is incomplete with missing data points for JPMorgan across multiple metrics, yet conclusions are drawn from this incomplete analysis. These fundamental inconsistencies in timing, data availability, and methodology force readers to piece together the actual argument themselves.",
