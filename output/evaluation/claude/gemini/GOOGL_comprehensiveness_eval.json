    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "While the report demonstrates solid structural organization with most expected sections present, it suffers from critical deficiencies that prevent a higher grade. The report lacks essential technology sector KPIs (ARR, retention rates, user metrics) in favor of generic financial metrics. Most critically, the valuation section fails to establish explicit linkages between operating drivers and valuation outcomes - the DCF model presents assumptions and outputs without connecting specific business drivers to cash flow projections. The report contains extensive redundancy, particularly around AI investment themes repeated across multiple sections without new depth. Additionally, meaningful peer benchmarking and scenario analysis are absent, limiting strategic context. Despite comprehensive coverage of regulatory risks and strong source citation, these structural weaknesses and the failure to link valuation drivers cap the grade at Fair.",
