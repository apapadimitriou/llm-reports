    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely unstated or buried in complex narratives without clear justification. Key valuation drivers like the 8.85% WACC, probability of success percentages (40-75%), and peak sales estimates ($3.5B-$7B per asset) appear without supporting evidence or methodology. The SOTP model uses 890M diluted shares versus 388M basic shares without explanation for this massive difference. Revenue projections show dramatic swings (2025E: $2.05B to 2028E: $15B) without underlying assumptions. Multiple contradictions exist: claiming 'aggressive cost-cutting' while extending breakeven from 2026 to 2028, and stating strong cash position while highlighting 'alarming cash burn.' No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers despite high execution risks. The assumptions lack specificity in units, timeframes, and causal drivers, making the valuation framework unauditable.",
