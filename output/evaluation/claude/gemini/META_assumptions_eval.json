    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet basic standards for assumption quality across all five pillars. While assumptions are explicitly stated in the Financial Model section, they lack adequate justification and contain internal contradictions. The revenue growth assumptions (17% for 2025, 13% for 2026-2027) are stated without supporting evidence from history, peers, or sources. The critical WACC of 9.5% is mentioned but not justified with market data or methodology. Most problematically, there are clear internal contradictions: the report states 2026 CapEx will show 'similarly significant dollar growth' but models $90B vs $70B (only 29% growth, not 'significant'). Operating margins are projected without clear drivers or reconciliation to the stated depreciation impacts. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers despite the report's emphasis on execution risk and volatile assumptions.",
