    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency problems that undermine its coherence. The narrative contains multiple unresolved contradictions between text and data tables, most notably claiming NII will be \"stable\" at $54.5B in 2025E while simultaneously discussing rate cut sensitivity as a major risk factor without reconciliation. The temporal accuracy is questionable, with references to \"recent\" developments and future earnings dates (July 15, 2025) that appear inconsistent with the report's actual timeframe. The Bulls/Bears analysis is entirely missing, leaving key investment arguments unbalanced. Many sections read as disconnected bullet points rather than flowing analysis, particularly the business segment reviews and risk discussions. While individual sections contain detailed information, they fail to connect into a cohesive investment argument. The extensive citation list suggests thoroughness, but the underlying analysis lacks the logical flow and internal consistency required for a coherent equity research report.",

        "Bulls/Bears section completely absent despite detailed discussion of both positive catalysts and significant risks throughout report",
        "Business segment sections read as isolated descriptions rather than integrated analysis supporting the investment thesis"
