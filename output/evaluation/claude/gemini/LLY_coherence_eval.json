    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid structural organization with clear sections and a coherent narrative arc from investment recommendation through detailed analysis. The language is generally clear and professional, with good use of connecting phrases like \"However\" and \"Furthermore\" to link ideas. The report maintains consistent terminology throughout and provides extensive citations. However, several significant issues prevent a higher grade. There are multiple temporal inaccuracies where sources accessed on September 10, 2025 are used to support a report dated June 6, 2025, creating impossible citation timelines. The Bulls/Bears section is entirely absent despite being mentioned in the executive summary, leaving potential counterarguments unaddressed. Some sections, particularly the ESG analysis, read more like data dumps with limited integration into the core investment thesis. While individual sections flow reasonably well, cross-references between sections could be stronger, and the heavy reliance on future-dated sources undermines the report's credibility.",
    "evidence": [
        "All sources show access date of 'September 10, 2025' while report is dated 'June 6, 2025' - temporally impossible citations throughout",
        "Executive summary promises 'Bulls/Bears' analysis but no such section exists in the report structure",
        "ESG section provides extensive peer comparison data but minimal connection to core valuation thesis beyond brief mention of pricing pressure"
