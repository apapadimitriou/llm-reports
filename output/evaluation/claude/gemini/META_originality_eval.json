    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates some analytical effort but falls short of providing truly original insights. While it presents detailed financial modeling and sector context, most insights are either generic to the tech/social media sector or restatements of publicly available information. The report correctly identifies the tension between AI investment and near-term financial metrics, but this observation lacks novelty as it's widely discussed in public discourse. The 'depreciation bomb' concept shows some synthesis but isn't sufficiently unique or actionable. The ESG analysis and regulatory discussion are largely boilerplate. The valuation methodology employs standard DCF approaches without novel drivers. The report reads more like a comprehensive summary with standard financial analysis rather than providing decision-relevant, company-specific insights that go beyond what's readily available in earnings calls and public filings.",
