    "summary_reasoning": "The report makes key assumptions explicit with specific magnitudes and timeframes, particularly for revenue growth (19.5% 5Y CAGR), operating margins (21% to 26%), and WACC (8.9%). Most assumptions are reasonably justified using consensus estimates, management guidance, and industry benchmarks. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers. While it presents bull/bear DCF scenarios with different growth and margin assumptions, these are limited to valuation outputs rather than comprehensive operational sensitivities. The WACC calculation contains internal inconsistencies - the detailed methodology yields 9.87% but is arbitrarily adjusted to 8.9% without clear justification. Additionally, some critical assumptions like the terminal growth rate (3.5%) and specific margin expansion paths receive minimal justification beyond brief statements.",
