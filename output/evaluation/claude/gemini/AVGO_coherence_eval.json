    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid structural organization and comprehensive coverage but suffers from several critical coherence issues that prevent it from achieving a higher grade. The narrative flows logically from investment thesis through financial analysis to risks, with clear section transitions and consistent terminology usage. However, multiple temporal inaccuracies severely undermine credibility - the report claims to be written in June 2025 while citing sources \"accessed September 10, 2025,\" creating impossible future references. The financial projections table contains unexplained inconsistencies, such as Q2'25 revenue jumping from $15.004B in the text to $15.952B in the table without reconciliation. Additionally, the Bulls/Bears analysis is completely absent despite being referenced in the abstract, leaving key investment arguments unbalanced. While the valuation methodology is thorough and the risk discussion comprehensive, these contradictions and omissions require readers to fill significant gaps themselves, preventing the report from reading as one seamless, internally consistent argument.",

        "Executive Summary references 'Bulls/Bears' analysis but no such section exists in the report structure"
