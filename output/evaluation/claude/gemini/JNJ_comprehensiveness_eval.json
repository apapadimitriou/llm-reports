    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "While the report covers most expected sections with reasonable depth, it suffers from significant gaps that prevent a higher grade. The Financials Snapshot lacks critical sector-specific KPIs for pharmaceuticals (R&D as % of sales, pipeline value metrics, regulatory approval timelines) and medical devices (procedure volumes, ASPs). The valuation section provides DCF methodology but fails to explicitly link operating drivers like pipeline success rates or Stelara decline scenarios to the $175 price target. Peer benchmarking is superficial, mentioning only LLY and PFE without detailed comparison tables. The report demonstrates good coverage of business strategy, risks, and capital allocation, with consistent sourcing throughout. However, the missing sector KPIs and weak valuation linkage trigger the Fair grade cap per evaluation criteria.",
