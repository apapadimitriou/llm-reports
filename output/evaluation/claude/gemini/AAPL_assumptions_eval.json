    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit key assumptions with specific units and timeframes, including revenue CAGR (6.5%), Services growth (over 10%), WACC (8.23%), and terminal growth (3.0%). However, justification is weak for most parameters - the WACC components lack sourcing, margin expansion assumptions are not benchmarked against peers, and Services growth projections lack detailed support beyond general statements about installed base expansion. Internal consistency is maintained throughout. The critical failure is the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis despite identifying material risks like tariffs (mentioned as 15% valuation impact but not modeled as scenarios) and regulatory pressures on App Store commissions. The report caps at Fair due to no meaningful stress-testing of assumptions through quantified ranges or scenarios for any material drivers.",
