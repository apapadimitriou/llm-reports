    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its readability and credibility. The most critical flaw is the complete disconnect between narrative claims and cited sources\u2014virtually every citation leads to inaccessible URLs or sources that don't support the specific claims made. For example, the report cites specific Q1 2025 financial figures with footnote 1, but the source is listed as 'SEC.gov, accessed September 10, 2025' when the report date is June 7, 2025, creating temporal impossibilities. The narrative contains multiple internal contradictions, such as simultaneously claiming strong AI momentum while acknowledging fundamental disruption risks to the search model. Tables present precise financial data without proper sourcing verification. The report reads more like a template filled with plausible but unverified data rather than a coherent analysis. Transitions between sections exist but often jump topics abruptly, and the extensive use of undefined technical jargon compounds the confusion. Most damaging is the temporal inaccuracy where 'accessed' dates for sources post-date the report date by months.",
