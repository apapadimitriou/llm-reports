    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "While this Apple report contains all major structural sections with detailed content, it suffers from critical deficiencies that cap the grade at Fair. Most significantly, the Financials Snapshot completely lacks technology sector-specific KPIs such as R&D spending ratios, product unit sales, installed base metrics, or Services attach rates - fundamental metrics for evaluating a technology hardware company. The valuation section, despite extensive DCF detail, fails to explicitly link operating drivers to valuation assumptions, particularly how Services growth rates and margin expansion translate to the $200 fair value. Additionally, peer benchmarking is entirely absent except for a brief ESG comparison table. The report demonstrates good sourcing consistency and comprehensive coverage of business fundamentals, but these structural gaps in sector-appropriate analysis and valuation linkage prevent a higher grade.",
