    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms and explicit assumptions, but falls short of comprehensive scenario analysis. The DCF valuation shows strong causal reasoning: \"volume growth was partially offset by a 6% decrease in realized prices\" and \"operating margins are expected to continue their expansion from the current levels, reaching a peak in the mid-40% range by 2028.\" Key assumptions are quantified and benchmarked: \"terminal growth rate of 3.0%\" and \"WACC of 7.3%.\" However, while the report mentions \"bull, base, and bear case scenarios were modeled,\" it provides minimal quantified sensitivity analysis beyond stating \"bear case...results in a valuation significantly below the $650 price target.\" The mechanism-rich reasoning around competitive dynamics (\"net realized prices...from roughly $7,000 annually today to as low as $3,000\") and operational risks creates actionable implications, but the lack of detailed scenario ranges limits the analytical depth.",
