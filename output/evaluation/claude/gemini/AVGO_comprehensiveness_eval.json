    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report covers most expected sections including Executive Summary, Business Strategy, Valuation, Risk Analysis, and Financial Snapshot with detailed quarterly data. However, it suffers from critical gaps that prevent a higher rating. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage from operating drivers to the $330 price target, using vague DCF assumptions without clear mathematical bridges. Peer benchmarking is superficial with limited context. Most concerning are missing core sector KPIs - the report lacks semiconductor-specific metrics like fab utilization, design wins, R&D intensity ratios, or inventory turns. The AI revenue tracking is good but insufficient for comprehensive semiconductor analysis. While sourcing appears consistent with 40 citations, some key claims about customer concentration and market positioning lack specific attribution. The report demonstrates good depth in AI strategy discussion but falls short of comprehensive equity research standards.",
