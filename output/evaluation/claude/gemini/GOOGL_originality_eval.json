    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates extensive research effort but falls short on originality. While it attempts several syntheses, they largely restate known market dynamics without novel insights. The 'AI pivot vs. regulatory scrutiny' framing is generic to all Big Tech companies. The DCF analysis uses standard assumptions (8.5% WACC, 2.75% terminal growth) without justifying these choices or identifying unique drivers. Most insights are either copied from earnings releases (Q1 performance metrics) or represent generic restatements ('AI-first strategy,' 'regulatory overhang'). The report lacks company-specific mechanisms, quantified pathways, or actionable catalysts that would distinguish Alphabet from peers facing similar challenges.",
