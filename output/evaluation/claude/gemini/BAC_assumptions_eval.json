    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical dimensions. Assumptions are largely unstated or opaque - key drivers like WACC (7.05%), long-term growth (7.0%), and NII exit rate ($15.5-15.7B Q4) appear without justification or sourcing. The report contains significant internal contradictions: revenue figures show $192.4B in 2024 but Q1 2025 at $27.4B (implying impossible $109.6B annual run-rate), and P/TBV ratios are inconsistent (1.77x vs 1.35x in different sections). Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers despite this being essential for bank analysis. The DCF methodology lacks specificity on key inputs, and peer comparisons have missing data points. While some assumptions are mentioned, they lack the evidence-based justification and stress-testing required for credible bank analysis.",
