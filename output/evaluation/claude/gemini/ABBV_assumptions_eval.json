    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails multiple critical tests for assumption quality. Key DCF assumptions are stated but poorly justified: WACC of 7.8% lacks proper derivation (claims 83%/17% equity/debt structure contradicting the $70B debt burden), cost of equity components appear fabricated (4.3% risk-free rate, 0.50 beta, 8.6% equity risk premium without sources), and terminal growth of 2.5% is unsupported. Revenue growth assumptions reference management guidance but lack specific quantification or sensitivity analysis. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios despite acknowledging 'High Uncertainty' and 'wide range of potential valuation outcomes.' The report mentions risks extensively but provides zero stress-testing of key drivers like competition timing, pipeline failures, or pricing pressure - a fatal flaw for a pharma company post-patent cliff. While some assumptions are explicit, the combination of weak justification, missing sensitivities, and internal inconsistencies around capital structure renders this analysis unreliable.",
