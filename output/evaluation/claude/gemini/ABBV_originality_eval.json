    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains zero synthesis or original theses and is dominated by generic restatements and copied content. The analysis consists entirely of standard pharmaceutical industry observations ('patent cliff navigation,' 'pipeline diversification,' 'M&A strategy') that could apply to any large pharma company. The valuation section presents a completely generic DCF model with standard assumptions (7.8% WACC, 2.5% terminal growth) without any novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. Multiple insights are directly copied or paraphrased from cited sources, including financial figures and strategic descriptions. The Bulls/Bears section offers textbook pharmaceutical industry talking points with no unique angles. No decision-relevant insights with specific catalysts, timelines, or differentiated perspectives are present.",
