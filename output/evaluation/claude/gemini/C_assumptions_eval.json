    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely unstated or opaque, scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. While some financial projections appear in tables (revenue $84.0B-$87.5B, expenses declining to $52.5B), critical drivers lack justification or specificity. The WACC/cost of equity assumption of \"9-10%\" appears only in passing without derivation. Revenue growth assumptions lack detailed breakdown by segment. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios for any material drivers. The efficiency ratio improvement assumption (\"mid-60s toward low 60s\") lacks supporting analysis. Credit cost projections ($14.5B-$15.0B) appear without methodology. The 1.0x P/TBV target multiple lacks rigorous justification beyond generic statements about cost of equity coverage. Share count reduction assumptions from the $20B buyback program are not quantified with timing or pace details.",
