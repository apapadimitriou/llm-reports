    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains several key assumptions that drive AbbVie's valuation, but they have mixed quality. On explicitness, the report clearly states assumptions like WACC (7.8%), cost of equity (8.6%), terminal growth rate (2.5%), and revenue CAGR (7.5%), typically near the forecasts they inform. For justification, some assumptions have partial support (e.g., terminal growth tied to GDP), but others lack robust evidence (e.g., WACC components). On specificity, the report provides precise figures with units and timeframes for most assumptions. However, consistency issues emerge with contradictory debt figures ($70B vs $69.9B) and capital structure weights. The most significant weakness is the complete absence of sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for key drivers like revenue growth, margins, or discount rates, which prevents readers from understanding the range of potential outcomes and makes the valuation appear as a black box with single-point estimates.",
