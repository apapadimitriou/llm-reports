    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The Adobe research report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major expected sections with appropriate depth. It includes a detailed investment summary, thorough business analysis, clear valuation methodology with explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value, and robust financial analysis with sector-appropriate KPIs like ARR and RPO. The report effectively integrates evidence throughout, with consistent citations to numbered sources. While the report covers competitive positioning, risks, and capital allocation well, it lacks formal scenario/sensitivity analysis and could benefit from more structured peer benchmarking beyond the basic valuation comparables table. The ESG section is present but relatively brief compared to other sections. Overall, the report provides a well-rounded, evidence-based analysis with minimal redundancy.",
