    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The Amazon equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language and mostly smooth transitions between sections. The narrative flows logically from the Analyst Note through Business Description, Strategy, and financial analysis, maintaining a consistent focus on key themes like AWS growth, retail profitability improvements, and the strategic AI investment cycle. Sections effectively reinforce each other, with the Bulls/Bears section properly reconciling tensions raised in the valuation narrative. The report maintains consistency in terminology and financial metrics throughout. Tables and numerical data align with the narrative claims, particularly regarding segment performance and margin expansion. The report proactively addresses potential contradictions, such as explaining why the massive capex investment that pressures near-term free cash flow is strategically necessary for long-term AI leadership. While most transitions are smooth, a few sections could benefit from stronger connective tissue between paragraphs. Overall, the report presents a coherent investment thesis with aligned assumptions, consistent terminology, and properly reconciled tensions.",
    "evidence": [
        "The report maintains narrative consistency across sections, with the $100B+ capex investment for AI infrastructure referenced consistently in the Analyst Note, Business Strategy, Bears Say, and Capital Allocation sections.",
        "The Bulls/Bears section effectively reconciles tensions with the base-case valuation, acknowledging both the 'Premium Valuation Risk' while explaining why the P/E ratio 'remains well below its 5-year average of ~53x, suggesting a more reasonable valuation in the context of accelerating earnings growth.'",
        "The report uses precise temporal claims that align with the dates provided, consistently referring to Q2 2025 results throughout and providing specific metrics like 'North America segment's operating margin expanded by 190 basis points to 7.5%' that match across sections."
