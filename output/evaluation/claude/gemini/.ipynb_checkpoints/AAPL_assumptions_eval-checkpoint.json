    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains several key assumptions that drive its valuation model, but they exhibit mixed quality. While assumptions are generally explicit and proximal to the forecasts they inform (e.g., revenue growth rates, margin expansion, discount rate), their justification is often partial or limited. The report provides specific magnitudes for most assumptions (e.g., 6-7% revenue CAGR, 8.23% WACC), but some lack robust supporting evidence beyond brief mentions of historical trends or strategic shifts. Internal consistency is generally maintained, though the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis for key drivers like regulatory impacts on Services growth. The absence of robust scenario analysis for material drivers like regulatory headwinds and tariff impacts (despite mentioning a 15% potential valuation impact) caps the overall grade at Fair, as these represent significant uncertainties that warrant more thorough stress-testing.",
