    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The Apple equity research report demonstrates strong coherence through clear language, logical flow, and consistent terminology. The narrative progresses naturally from company overview through business strategy, competitive advantages, valuation, and risks. Sections reference each other effectively, with valuation assumptions clearly tied to business drivers discussed in earlier sections. For example, the Services growth projections in the Fair Value section directly connect to ecosystem strength highlighted in the Economic Moat section. The report maintains consistency between narrative claims and numerical data in tables, with financial projections aligning with the strategic outlook. Terminology is used precisely throughout, with concepts like 'economic moat' and 'switching costs' defined and applied consistently. The report also handles temporal references appropriately, with events like the 'recent WWDC in June 2025' accurately described relative to the report date. While the report excels in most aspects of coherence, there are minor areas for improvement, such as more explicit connections between the Bulls/Bears section and the base-case valuation, particularly regarding how regulatory risks are quantified in the valuation model.",
    "evidence": [
        "The report maintains consistency between strategic claims and financial projections, with the 'five-year compound annual revenue growth rate (CAGR) of 6-7% through fiscal 2029' in the Fair Value section aligning with the 'Services revenue will grow at a compound annual rate of over 10% for the next five years' in the Business Strategy section.",
        "Sections reference each other effectively, as seen when the Risk & Uncertainty section quantifies 'a potential 25% gross downside risk to our valuation if iPhones lose their tariff exemption' which connects to the earlier Analyst Note mentioning 'tariffs, which could impact our valuation by up to 15% net of mitigation efforts'.",
        "Temporal references are accurate throughout, with the report dated June 9, 2025, appropriately describing the 'recent Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2025' and the '$100 billion share repurchase authorization' from 'May 2025'."
