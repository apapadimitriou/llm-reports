    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The AbbVie equity research report demonstrates strong coherence through clear language, logical flow, and consistent messaging across sections. The narrative maintains a cohesive investment thesis centered on AbbVie's transition beyond Humira through Skyrizi/Rinvoq growth and strategic M&A. Sections effectively reference each other, with valuation assumptions clearly tied to growth drivers identified in the Business Strategy section and risks that appropriately qualify the bullish outlook. The report maintains consistency between narrative claims and supporting data, with financial projections in the tables aligning with textual discussions. Terminology is used precisely throughout, with clear definitions of key metrics like WACC and consistent treatment of product names. While transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, a few sections (particularly in the Business Description) read somewhat list-like, though this doesn't significantly impair overall coherence. The report effectively reconciles the Bulls/Bears perspectives with the base-case valuation, acknowledging both the growth potential and debt concerns that influence the Hold rating and slight discount to fair value.",
    "evidence": [
        "The report maintains consistency between narrative claims and financial data, with statements like 'We model a 5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 7.5%' aligning with the Financials Snapshot table showing revenue growth from $56.3B (2024) to $80.8B (2029).",
        "The Bulls/Bears section effectively balances optimistic views ('Skyrizi and Rinvoq are on a clear trajectory to collectively surpass Humira's peak sales') with concerns ('The balance sheet is heavily leveraged, with total debt approaching $70 billion'), which are reconciled in the Fair Value section's balanced P/E multiple of 16.0x.",
        "The report demonstrates strong cross-referencing between sections, with the Risk & Uncertainty section directly addressing concerns raised in both the Business Strategy section (M&A integration) and Bears Say section (debt burden)."
