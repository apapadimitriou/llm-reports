    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies that fundamentally undermine its credibility. The report is dated June 9, 2025, yet contains multiple references to future events as if they were past occurrences, including 'Apple reports third quarter results' from July 31, 2025, and WWDC June 2025 events described in past tense. The narrative flow is choppy with abrupt transitions between topics, particularly in the Business Strategy section which jumps from ecosystem integration to Services growth to AI initiatives without clear connective tissue. Multiple contradictions exist between the Bulls/Bears arguments and the base-case valuation narrative - for example, Bears emphasize regulatory risks to App Store revenue while the base case projects robust 10%+ Services growth with only modest commission rate moderation in later years. The ESG section reads like a disconnected bullet list with no transitions between risk categories. While individual sections contain detailed analysis, the overall coherence is severely compromised by these temporal impossibilities and internal inconsistencies.",
