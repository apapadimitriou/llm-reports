    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit assumptions with specific figures and locations, particularly in the Fair Value section and Appendix. Key drivers like revenue CAGR (4.0%), mid-cycle ROTCE (18.5%), cost of equity (10.5%), and terminal growth (3.0%) are clearly stated with units and timeframes. Justification is partial - some assumptions reference historical performance and peer comparisons, but many lack robust supporting evidence. The report shows good internal consistency with figures reconciling across sections. However, the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on any material drivers caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rule. While the report mentions risks qualitatively, it provides no scenarios or ranges for key variables like interest rates, credit losses, or economic downturns that could materially impact the $235 fair value estimate.",
