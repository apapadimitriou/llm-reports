    "summary_reasoning": "While the report lists several key assumptions in the DCF table (WACC 10.3%, terminal growth 3.0%, 5-year revenue CAGR 9.5%, terminal operating margin 15.0%), these assumptions are largely unjustified and lack specificity. The WACC is claimed to be 'in line with industry benchmarks' but no sources or calculations are provided. The revenue CAGR is said to 'align with consensus analyst forecasts' without citing specific sources. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers despite the >$100B capex cycle and competitive pressures being central to the investment thesis. The report mentions risks and uncertainties but provides no quantified ranges or stress testing. Operating margin expansion assumptions lack detailed justification beyond general statements about mix shift. The absence of any sensitivity analysis on material drivers like AWS growth, capex efficiency, or competitive impact represents a fundamental gap in assumption quality.",
