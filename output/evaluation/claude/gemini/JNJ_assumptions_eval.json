    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit assumptions with clear units and timeframes, but suffers from weak justification and limited sensitivity analysis. Key assumptions like WACC (8.14%), terminal growth (2.0%), and revenue growth (4.5% CAGR) are stated but lack proper sourcing or benchmarking evidence. The WACC calculation claims specific inputs (7.98% cost of equity, 4.06% risk-free rate, 0.95 beta) but these are unsupported assertions. Revenue forecasts show specific segment growth rates but justification relies mainly on management guidance rather than independent analysis. Operating margins are assumed stable at 25-26% with minimal explanation. The report includes qualitative scenario analysis (bull/bear cases with $200/$150 price targets) but lacks quantified sensitivities for material drivers like Stelara decline rates or litigation costs. While assumptions are generally consistent across tables and narrative, the absence of robust quantified sensitivity analysis on key value drivers caps the grade at Fair.",
