{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit assumptions for key drivers like revenue CAGR (4.0%), WACC (6.8%), terminal growth (2.5%), and margin expansion targets (4.2% to 4.5%). However, justification is weak - the WACC lacks detailed derivation, revenue growth assumptions are not benchmarked against peers or multi-year history, and margin expansion relies heavily on unproven integration benefits. Specificity is partial with clear units and timeframes but vague causal drivers. Internal consistency has minor issues with EPS forecasts ($6.25 vs guidance range $6.00-$6.20). Most critically, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenarios for any material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rule. The assumptions feel more asserted than rigorously justified.",
