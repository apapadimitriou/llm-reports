    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies and structural coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its credibility. The most glaring problem is the systematic misrepresentation of timing: the report claims to be analyzing Q2 FY25 results from June 2025 while being written in August 2025, yet repeatedly refers to events as 'recent' that would be months old by the stated analysis date. The current price is listed as June 12, 2025, but earnings reactions are described as immediate market responses. Beyond temporal confusion, the report exhibits poor structural flow with abrupt topic transitions, particularly in the investment thesis section where bull/bear cases jump between AI integration, competitive threats, and valuation without clear connective reasoning. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet points rather than coherent analysis. The financial projections section lacks proper integration with the qualitative assessment, and key assumptions in the DCF model are inadequately supported. While the report demonstrates comprehensive research with extensive citations, the fundamental issues with temporal accuracy and logical flow severely compromise its analytical coherence.",
    "evidence": [
        "Report dated August 12, 2025 analyzes 'recent' Q2 results from June 2025, with current price 'as of June 12, 2025' yet describes immediate market reactions as if contemporaneous (Section 1.0)",
        "Bull/bear case analysis jumps abruptly between AI integration, competitive threats, and financial metrics without transitional logic or cross-referencing to valuation assumptions (Section 3.0)",
        "Multiple sections like ESG and risks read as disconnected appendices with minimal integration to the core investment thesis (Section 7.0)"
