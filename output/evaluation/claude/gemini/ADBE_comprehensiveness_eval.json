    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections including analyst note, business description, valuation, risks, and financials snapshot. However, it suffers from significant gaps that prevent a higher rating. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and the $530 price target\u2014the DCF methodology is mentioned but key assumptions and calculations are not shown. Critical sector KPIs for software companies are missing, including customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), churn rates, and detailed ARR metrics beyond headline figures. While peer comparison is attempted, it's incomplete with missing data for most competitors. The report demonstrates good sourcing with 44 citations, but some redundancy exists across sections, particularly regarding AI monetization themes. The financial projections are present but lack scenario analysis or sensitivity testing.",
