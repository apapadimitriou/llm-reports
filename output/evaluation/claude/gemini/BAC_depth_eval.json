    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some causal explanations like \"NII was driven by robust net interest income\" and mentions assumptions such as \"long-term earnings growth rate of 7.0%\" and \"cost of equity calculated at 7.05%\", these lack proper benchmarking or justification. The report provides no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing. Key assumptions like the \"DCF yields approximately $59.00\" and \"P/TBV multiple of 1.85x\" are stated without ranges or stress-testing. The analysis fails to explore counterpoints meaningfully - mentioning \"commercial real estate stress\" but not quantifying potential impacts. Most concerning is the absence of mechanism-rich reasoning connecting assumptions to outcomes, making implications generic rather than actionable.",
