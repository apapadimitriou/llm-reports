    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates poor assumption quality across all five pillars. While some assumptions are explicitly stated, they lack proper justification and contain significant contradictions. The DCF analysis claims a WACC of 8.5% but provides conflicting sources (\"blend from multiple data providers\" vs. specific beta of 1.5 that doesn't reconcile). Terminal growth of 3.5% is stated without justification. Operating margin assumptions of 45-46% are mentioned but not reconciled across different sections. Most critically, there are zero sensitivity analyses or scenarios despite this being a valuation-dependent investment thesis. The revenue growth assumptions lack specificity about drivers, and the AI monetization assumptions ($125M run-rate doubling) are mentioned but not integrated into forecasts. Internal contradictions include inconsistent margin figures and unexplained gaps between historical data and projections.",
