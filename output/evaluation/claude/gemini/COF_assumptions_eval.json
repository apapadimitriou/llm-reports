    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from fundamental deficiencies in assumption quality that render the valuation unreliable. Key assumptions are largely unstated or opaque - the WACC of 10.5% appears without justification, terminal growth rates lack support, and critical drivers like loan growth rates and normalized charge-off assumptions are missing. The DCF sensitivity table provides only a narrow range (2.0-2.5% terminal growth, 9.5-11.5% WACC) without explaining parameter selection. Multiple contradictions exist: NIM is stated as both 6.93% and 6.9% for Q1 2025, and synergy figures vary between $1.2B and $1.3B without reconciliation. The financials table contains extensive 'insufficient data' entries, making verification impossible. While some assumptions are mentioned (network synergies, integration costs), they lack the specificity, evidence-based justification, and comprehensive sensitivity analysis required for a reliable valuation model.",
