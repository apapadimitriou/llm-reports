    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits significant structural deficiencies that render it incomplete for equity research standards. While it contains extensive narrative content across multiple sections, it fundamentally fails to provide essential analytical components. The report completely lacks a proper financials snapshot with historical data and sector-specific KPIs for asset management (AUM growth rates, fee rates by segment, organic growth metrics). The valuation section, despite lengthy discussion, fails to explicitly link operating drivers to valuation assumptions with clear mathematical bridges. Critical sections including competitive positioning analysis, ESG considerations, and capital allocation strategy are either missing or inadequately addressed. The report suffers from extensive redundancy, particularly around the strategic pivot narrative which is repeated across multiple sections without adding analytical depth. Most critically, claims like specific financial projections and strategic targets lack proper source citations, undermining the report's credibility and analytical rigor.",
