    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report covers most expected sections including executive summary, business strategy, segment analysis, financials, valuation, and risks. However, it suffers from critical deficiencies that cap the grade at Fair. The financial snapshot lacks essential banking sector KPIs (NIM, loan loss provisions, efficiency ratio, loan growth) and instead provides only basic revenue/EPS data. The valuation section fails to establish explicit linkages between operating drivers and the $95 price target, simply applying a 1.0x P/TBV multiple without connecting specific operational improvements to this outcome. Peer benchmarking is superficial with incomplete data marked as 'illustrative' and 'estimates.' The report demonstrates significant redundancy, repeating the SCB reduction and strategic transformation themes across multiple sections without adding new depth. While comprehensive in coverage, these structural weaknesses prevent it from achieving a Good rating.",
