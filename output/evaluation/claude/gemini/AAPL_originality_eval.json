    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Apple report demonstrates minimal originality and relies heavily on generic financial analysis and boilerplate content. While it presents some company-specific data points, virtually all insights are either copied from standard sources or represent generic restatements that could apply to any large technology company. The report lacks synthesis of multiple data points into new conclusions and presents no original theses with specific mechanisms or catalysts. Key sections like the economic moat analysis use standard 'walled garden' terminology without fresh perspective. The valuation section employs conventional DCF methodology with standard assumptions but provides no novel drivers or unique analytical angles. The business strategy discussion merely restates publicly available information about Apple Intelligence and supply chain investments without connecting these to specific financial implications or competitive positioning insights.",
