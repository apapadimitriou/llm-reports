    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a comprehensive list of key assumptions but falls short of good quality standards due to significant weaknesses. While assumptions are generally explicit and proximal to forecasts (revenue CAGR ~20%, AI growth >50%, operating margins toward 70%), justification is often weak or absent. The WACC assumption of 9.1% acknowledges a wide range (8.7%-11.3%) among providers but lacks detailed justification for the specific choice. Terminal growth of 3.0% is stated without support. Most critically, the report provides only qualitative sensitivity analysis, mentioning that a 200bp WACC change affects valuation by 15-20% but offering no quantified scenarios for other material drivers like AI growth deceleration or VMware integration risks. Internal consistency appears clean with no major contradictions found between narrative and tables. The specificity is partial - some assumptions include units and timeframes while others remain vague.",
