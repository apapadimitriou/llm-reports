    "reasoning": "This report demonstrates clear structural organization and generally coherent language, but suffers from several critical issues that prevent a higher grade. Most significantly, there are temporal contradictions throughout - the report is dated June 17, 2025, yet references future events like an 'Investor Conference on June 16, 2025' and cites Q2 2025 earnings results that wouldn't be available on the report date. The narrative references withdrawal of 2025 guidance while simultaneously citing Q2 2025 results and raised guidance. Additionally, there's a fundamental contradiction between the narrative describing guidance withdrawal and uncertainty versus the financial table showing confident specific forecasts through 2029. The Bulls/Bears section lacks reconciliation with the base-case valuation - bears emphasize regulatory headwinds and execution risks that could 'cap long-term margin potential,' yet the DCF model assumes successful margin recovery to 4.5% by 2029 without addressing this tension. While individual sections are well-written with smooth transitions, these unresolved contradictions and temporal inaccuracies significantly undermine the report's coherence.",
