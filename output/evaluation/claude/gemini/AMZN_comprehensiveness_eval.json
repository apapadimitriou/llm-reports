    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report covers most expected sections with a complete contents page, but suffers from significant weaknesses that prevent a higher grade. The Financials Snapshot omits critical retail KPIs like same-store sales growth, third-party seller metrics, Prime membership growth rates, and AWS-specific metrics beyond basic revenue. The valuation section provides DCF assumptions but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to valuation outcomes - it states profit drivers but doesn't show how changes in AWS growth or retail margins translate to the $245 fair value. Peer benchmarking is completely absent throughout all sections. While sources are extensively cited, some key claims about capacity constraints and AI investment returns lack specific supporting data. The report demonstrates reasonable depth in business description and strategy but lacks the analytical rigor expected for comprehensive equity research.",
