    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from critical deficiencies across all five quality pillars. While assumptions are somewhat explicit, they lack proper justification with most key parameters unsupported by evidence. The WACC of 8.5% and terminal growth of 2.75% are stated without derivation or benchmarking. Revenue growth projections of 12.7% for 2025 and ~10% CAGR lack historical context or peer comparison. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities beyond a single WACC scenario in the DCF. Internal inconsistencies exist between text claims and data presentation. The $75B capex figure appears in multiple contexts without clear sourcing. Overall, the assumptions feel black-box with insufficient rigor for material drivers that determine the $210 price target.",
