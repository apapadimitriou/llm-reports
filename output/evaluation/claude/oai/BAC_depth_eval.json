    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some causal reasoning with statements like \"NII was $14.6B, driven by higher yielding assets\" and \"Operating costs grow slower than revenue due to scale.\" Key assumptions are explicitly stated (\"net interest margin stabilizing around ~3.3%,\" \"WACC of ~9%,\" \"terminal growth rate is ~2.5%\") but lack benchmarking or justification. The report mentions counterpoints such as \"If the Fed cuts rates, net interest margins could compress\" but provides no quantified sensitivity analysis. While it projects \"steadily rising NII\" and specific EPS growth targets, these forecasts lack stress-testing or scenario analysis. The valuation model uses explicit assumptions but doesn't explore ranges or alternative outcomes, limiting decision-relevant insights for investors facing uncertainty.",
