    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable depth, including analyst note, business description, strategy, bulls/bears, moat analysis, valuation, risks, capital allocation, and financials. However, it suffers from critical sector-specific KPI omissions for cybersecurity companies. The financials snapshot lacks key SaaS metrics like ARR growth rates, net revenue retention (NRR), customer acquisition costs (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), or churn rates - mentioning ARR only in narrative without systematic tracking. The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to fair value calculations. Peer benchmarking is completely absent despite competitive references. Sources are consistently cited throughout, but some redundancy exists across sections regarding cybersecurity demand drivers. The report reads more like a traditional equity analysis rather than a sector-appropriate SaaS/cybersecurity evaluation.",
