    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all major sections with reasonable depth and includes appropriate banking KPIs (CET1, ROTCE, NIM references). However, it suffers from significant weaknesses that prevent a higher grade. The Financials Snapshot uses generic metrics (Revenue, Op. Margin, EPS, FCF, ROIC) rather than core banking KPIs like NIM, loan loss provisions, or deposit growth rates. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and the $85 fair value outcome - it mentions assumptions but doesn't show how they flow through to the final valuation. Peer benchmarking is completely absent except for brief mentions of trading below peers' P/B ratios. The report shows good sourcing consistency and covers ESG risks appropriately, but the missing sector-specific KPIs in the financial table and weak valuation linkage trigger the Fair grade cap.",
