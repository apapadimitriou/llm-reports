    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical dimensions. Key assumptions are largely opaque and unjustified. The revenue growth assumption of ~12% CAGR lacks any supporting analysis or peer comparison. Operating margin stabilization at mid-40s is stated without justification despite current 45% margins. The 8.5% WACC appears arbitrary with no derivation shown, while cost of equity jumps from 8.5% to 10% without explanation. Multiple internal contradictions exist: WACC stated as both 8.5% and derived as 10% from appendix components, and projected operating margins declining from current 45% to 40% then recovering without rationale. Free cash flow projections show extreme volatility (dropping from $40B to $10B then recovering) with no explanation. Most critically, there are zero sensitivity analyses or scenarios for any material drivers, capping the grade at Fair, but the numerous contradictions and unjustified assumptions drive this to Poor.",
