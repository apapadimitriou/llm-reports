    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely unstated or opaque, with critical valuation inputs scattered throughout without proper justification. While the appendix mentions key assumptions (WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 2.0%, revenue CAGR ~5%), these lack supporting evidence or derivation. The revenue growth assumption of \"mid-single-digit\" and \"CAGR ~5%\" appears arbitrary without peer benchmarks or historical analysis. Operating margin projections (22% to 30% by 2029) are unsupported by cost structure analysis. The WACC components (Rf ~4%, ERP ~5%) are stated without market data or methodology. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios for any material drivers, despite acknowledging high uncertainty. The financial table shows precise forecasts but the underlying assumptions driving these numbers are not explicitly connected or justified, making the model essentially a black box.",
