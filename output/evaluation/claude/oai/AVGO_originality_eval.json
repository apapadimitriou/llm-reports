    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly composed of restated information from sources with minimal original analysis. While it contains extensive company detail, the vast majority of insights are generic restatements that could apply to any semiconductor company (e.g., 'AI boom driving growth,' 'diversified model reduces risk'). The few candidate syntheses identified are weak and lack quantified mechanisms or specific catalysts. The valuation section relies on standard DCF methodology without novel drivers or company-specific insights. Most critically, the report fails to provide decision-relevant analysis that goes beyond paraphrasing public sources, with multiple instances of copied phrasing and boilerplate commentary.",
