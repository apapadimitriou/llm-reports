    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all major sections with appropriate structure and sector-relevant KPIs for SaaS (ARR growth, ACV metrics, retention rates). However, it suffers from significant redundancy, with Q2 2025 results repeated across multiple sections without adding new depth. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value assumptions - the DCF inputs appear disconnected from the business analysis. Peer benchmarking is minimal, limited to brief ESG comparisons rather than comprehensive competitive analysis. While sources are consistently cited and sector KPIs are present, the repetitive content and weak valuation linkage prevent a higher grade.",
