    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "This Adobe report demonstrates reasonable overall structure but suffers from several coherence issues that prevent a higher grade. The narrative flow is choppy with abrupt transitions between topics, particularly in the Business Strategy section which jumps from competitive advantages to AI integration to market size without clear connective tissue. Multiple contradictions emerge: the Bulls/Bears section claims 'down 20% YTD' while the Analyst Note states shares fell '~7% post-report,' creating temporal confusion. The report references a Morningstar fair value of '$590' in Bulls Say but uses '$430' throughout its own valuation without reconciling this significant discrepancy. Terminology inconsistencies appear with 'electrification of media | content' (unclear phrasing) and inconsistent use of financial metrics. While individual sections contain solid analysis, the report reads more like assembled components than a unified argument. The extensive citations are generally aligned with claims, and the financial projections appear internally consistent. However, the combination of contradictory data points, weak transitions, and unreconciled external valuations significantly undermines coherence.",
