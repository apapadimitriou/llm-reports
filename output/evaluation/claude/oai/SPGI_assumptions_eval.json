    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered without clear justification. Key drivers like revenue CAGR (~5-6%), operating margin expansion (to ~42%), WACC (~8%), and terminal growth (~2%) are stated but lack supporting evidence from history, peers, or sources. The report contains a significant contradiction: it assumes ~2% annual share count reduction from buybacks while simultaneously showing EPS growing from $12.51 (2023) to $22.0 (2029F) - a 12% CAGR that's inconsistent with stated revenue growth of 5-6%. Most assumptions appear in summary form without specificity regarding units, timeframes, or causal drivers. No sensitivity analysis or scenario testing is provided for any material drivers. The financial projections table shows precise figures but the underlying methodology and assumptions driving these forecasts are not explained or justified, making the model feel like a black box.",
