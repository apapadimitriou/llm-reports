    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inconsistencies that fundamentally undermine its coherence. Multiple 'recent' events are cited with future dates (2025) while the report date is July 8, 2025, creating impossible chronologies. The analyst discusses Q2 and Q3 2025 guidance as forward-looking when these quarters should already be completed by the report date. Critical contradictions emerge between sections: the Bulls/Bears analysis presents AI-driven secular growth versus cyclical semiconductor risks without reconciliation in the base-case valuation narrative. The report jumps abruptly between topics with minimal transitions, particularly in the Business Strategy section which reads like disconnected bullet points. Revenue projections show inconsistencies between narrative descriptions and the financial table. While individual sections contain detailed information, the overall argument lacks connective tissue and internal logic, forcing readers to assemble the investment thesis themselves.",
