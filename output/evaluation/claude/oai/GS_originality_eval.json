    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains mostly restated information from public sources with minimal original analysis. While it demonstrates company knowledge and some attempt at synthesis, the insights are largely generic and lack decision-relevant specificity. The report recycles standard investment banking themes (cyclical recovery, regulatory challenges, market leadership) without providing unique angles or quantified mechanisms. The valuation section relies on standard DCF methodology with no novel drivers beyond generic margin expansion assumptions. Most content directly paraphrases Reuters articles, and the few synthesis attempts (linking tariffs to deal activity, connecting trading volatility to earnings) are superficial without deeper causal analysis or specific catalysts.",
