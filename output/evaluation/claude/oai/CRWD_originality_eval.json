    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, consisting primarily of copied financial metrics and generic cybersecurity industry commentary. The vast majority of insights are direct restatements from earnings releases and news sources without meaningful synthesis. Key sections like the analyst note, business strategy, and bulls/bears simply paraphrase public information with no unique analytical framework. The valuation section relies on standard DCF assumptions without novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. While the report covers CrowdStrike comprehensively, it fails to provide decision-relevant insights that go beyond what's readily available in public filings and news coverage. No meaningful synthesis connects multiple data points into new conclusions, and the analysis lacks company-specific angles that would differentiate it from generic sector research.",
