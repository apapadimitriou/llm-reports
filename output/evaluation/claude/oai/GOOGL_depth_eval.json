    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some causal statements like \"revenue rose 12% year-on-year\" and \"advertising sales grew a solid 8.5%\", these lack mechanistic explanation. The valuation section mentions key assumptions (\"9% WACC\", \"terminal growth rate of ~4%\", \"5-year revenue CAGR of ~10%\") but provides no benchmarking, sensitivity analysis, or ranges. Forecasts like \"mid-teens EPS growth\" and \"operating margin ticking up to the mid-30s\" are unsupported generalizations without underlying drivers. The report lists risks but fails to quantify their impact or explore scenarios. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities (e.g., \"if ad spending falls X%, EPS drops Y%\") or alternative scenarios that would make implications actionable for investors.",
