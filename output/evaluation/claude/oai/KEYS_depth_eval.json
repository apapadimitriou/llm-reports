    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some basic causal links like \"CSG led growth driven by commercial telecom and aerospace/defense demand,\" most explanations are superficial. The DCF assumptions are stated without benchmarking: \"WACC ~9%, terminal growth ~2%\" appears with no industry comparison or sensitivity analysis. Revenue projections show \"5-6% CAGR\" but lack explicit drivers or stress testing. The report mentions \"gradual recovery\" multiple times but provides no quantified scenarios for different recovery paths. Valuation relies on generic multiples (\"20-21\u00d7 forward P/E\") without exploring ranges or downside cases. Risk factors are listed descriptively but not quantified into impact scenarios. The analysis fails to provide decision-relevant sensitivity analysis or robust causal mechanisms linking assumptions to outcomes.",
