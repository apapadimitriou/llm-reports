    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. While some assumptions appear in narrative form (~3% revenue CAGR, 9% WACC, 2% terminal growth), they lack proper justification with multi-year history or peer benchmarks. The report contains a significant contradiction between claiming 'flat share count' while simultaneously discussing ongoing heavy buybacks and 30 million new shares for compensation. Critical assumptions like specific margin improvement drivers, credit cost expectations, and tax rate justifications are missing or vague. Most importantly, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios for any material drivers, making the valuation feel like a black box. The assumptions that do appear are weakly supported and inconsistent with the report's own narrative about ongoing restructuring costs and dilution.",
