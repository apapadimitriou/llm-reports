    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some basic causal statements like \"revenue growth driven by travel/entertainment spending\" and \"cost discipline boosting profit,\" these lack specific mechanisms or quantification. The report provides vague assumptions such as \"7-8% annual revenue growth\" and \"WACC ~8%\" but offers no benchmarking or sensitivity analysis. No scenarios are explored (e.g., what happens if growth is 5% vs 10%, or if WACC changes). The valuation methodology mentions DCF but provides no stress tests or ranges around the $290 fair value. Counterpoints are listed generically without quantified impacts. The financial projections show precise numbers through 2029 but lack any explanation of underlying drivers or alternative outcomes. Overall, the analysis reads more like a summary of recent results and generic forward-looking statements rather than rigorous analytical reasoning.",
