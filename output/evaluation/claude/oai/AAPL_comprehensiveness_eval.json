    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Apple report covers most expected sections with reasonable depth, including analyst note, business description, valuation, risks, and financials. However, it suffers from significant gaps that prevent a higher rating. The financials snapshot lacks critical sector-specific KPIs for technology companies (R&D as % of revenue, gross margins by segment, services attach rates, device unit sales). Peer benchmarking is completely absent - no comparison to Samsung, Google, or other tech giants. The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly link operating drivers (iPhone upgrade cycles, services growth rates, market share changes) to the $185 fair value outcome. Redundancy is evident with tariff impacts and AI delays mentioned repeatedly across sections without new insights. While sourcing appears consistent and the report demonstrates comprehensive coverage of Apple's business, the missing sector KPIs and weak valuation linkage trigger the Fair grade cap.",
