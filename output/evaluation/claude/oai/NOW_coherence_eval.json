    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that undermine its coherence. Most critically, there are multiple temporal contradictions that render the analysis unreliable: the report claims to analyze Q2 2025 results reported on July 23, 2025, while being dated July 24, 2025, yet cites sources from March and April 2025 as future events. The Bulls/Bears section contains unresolved contradictions with the base case - bulls cite strong AI demand and robust financials justifying current valuation, while the DCF yields a $370 fair value against a $975 current price, suggesting the stock is significantly overvalued. This fundamental disconnect is never addressed. Additionally, several sections read like disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections. The narrative jumps abruptly between topics without logical flow, and key assumptions in the valuation model lack proper justification or reconciliation with the qualitative analysis.",

        "Report dated 2025-07-24 analyzes 'Q2 2025 results reported July 23' but cites Axios sources from 'Mar 10, 2025' and 'Jul 24, 2025' creating impossible temporal relationships",
        "Bulls argue stock justified at current levels citing 'strong demand' and 'robust financial profile' while DCF shows fair value $370 vs current $975 (2.6x overvalued) with no reconciliation of this contradiction",
        "Business Description section lacks transitions, jumping from founding to offerings to geography to customer segments without connecting logic"
