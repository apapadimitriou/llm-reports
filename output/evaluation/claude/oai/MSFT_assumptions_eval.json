    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet basic standards for assumption quality. While it states some key assumptions like 13% revenue CAGR through 2029 and 8% WACC, these are largely unjustified and lack specificity. The revenue growth assumption provides no breakdown by segment or causal drivers. The 8% WACC is mentioned only as reflecting AAA credit rating without any calculation or components. Operating margin assumptions (44-46%) lack justification for the projected recovery. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios for any material drivers, automatically capping the grade at Fair. Additionally, several assumptions are opaque or missing entirely, including terminal growth rate specifics, tax rate assumptions, and detailed capex projections. The EPS forecasts appear inconsistent with stated margin assumptions when cross-checked against revenue projections. The combination of weak justification, missing sensitivities, and internal inconsistencies results in a Poor rating.",
