{
    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from critical deficiencies in assumption quality. Key valuation drivers are largely unstated or opaque: the DCF model mentions WACC ~8-9% and terminal growth ~3% without justification, revenue growth assumptions of 5-7% lack supporting evidence, and operating margin forecasts are unsupported. Multiple contradictions exist between text and tables - Q1'25 transaction fee revenue is cited as both rising 4% YoY and reaching $1.23B, while the financials table shows impossible precision for future years without basis. The report provides no sensitivity analysis or quantified scenarios for any material drivers. While some assumptions are mentioned in passing, they lack the explicitness, justification, and specificity required for a credible valuation model. The combination of opaque assumptions, internal contradictions, and complete absence of sensitivities renders the analysis unreliable.",
