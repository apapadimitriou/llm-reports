    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains extensive content but suffers from pervasive copying and paraphrasing from cited sources with minimal original analysis. Most insights are generic restatements of public information (AI boom, China restrictions, CUDA ecosystem) without company-specific synthesis. While the report mentions some quantified projections (15% CAGR, $125 fair value), these appear to be largely borrowed from Morningstar rather than original analysis. The valuation section lacks novel drivers beyond standard DCF assumptions. The few potential syntheses (linking geopolitical risk to supply chain diversification, margin normalization timeline) are weakly developed and lack specific mechanisms or catalysts. The report reads more like a comprehensive summary of public sources than original equity research with actionable insights.",
