    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered without proper justification. While the Appendix mentions key DCF inputs (WACC ~9%, terminal growth ~2%, tax rate ~15%), these critical assumptions lack any supporting evidence or rationale. The revenue growth forecast of '~5-6% CAGR' and operating margins of '27-29%' are stated without historical benchmarks, peer comparisons, or clear drivers. Multiple internal contradictions exist: EPS drops from $5.9 to $3.5 in FY2024 then jumps to $6.0 in FY2025F without explanation; operating margins show inconsistent patterns (25.5% to 24.4% to 27.3% to 27.0%); and ROIC fluctuates wildly (28% to 24% to 27% to 25%) with no underlying logic. The report provides no sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers. The fair value estimate of $170 appears to be derived from unstated assumptions, making the valuation effectively a black box.",
