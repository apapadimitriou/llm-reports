    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits pervasive copying and paraphrasing from sources with minimal original analysis. The majority of insights are either directly restated from cited sources (tariff costs, Chinese competition, services growth percentages) or consist of generic technology sector observations applicable to any major tech company. The valuation section relies entirely on standard DCF methodology with no novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. While the report contains extensive detail, it lacks synthesis of multiple data points into new conclusions or original theses with specific catalysts and timelines. The analysis reads more like a compilation of existing research rather than value-added equity analysis.",
