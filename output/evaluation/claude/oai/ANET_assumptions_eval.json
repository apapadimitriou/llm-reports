    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and fail to meet basic quality standards. While some key drivers are mentioned (15-18% revenue CAGR, 40-42% operating margins, 9-10% WACC), they lack proper justification and specificity. The WACC range is stated without any supporting calculation or market data. Revenue growth assumptions reference management guidance but provide no quantitative backing or peer comparisons. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers. The financial table contains unexplained inconsistencies (ROIC jumping from 28.5% to 36% with no explanation, EPS figures that don't align with stated assumptions). The fair value estimate is completely missing (shown as $X), making the valuation framework unauditable. The assumptions appear scattered throughout the narrative rather than being explicitly stated near the forecasts they drive.",
