    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates reasonable structure and comprehensive coverage but suffers from several significant issues that prevent a higher grade. Most critically, there are temporal inconsistencies that undermine credibility - the report date is June 4, 2025, yet it references future events like 'FY2026 guidance' and cites sources from March 2025 as if they're historical. The Bulls/Bears section presents strong arguments but fails to reconcile the bears' valuation concerns with the base-case fair value of $450, which sits very close to the current price of $468 despite acknowledging 'rich multiples.' While individual sections are well-written with good use of data and citations, transitions between sections are often abrupt, particularly moving from financial analysis to ESG considerations. The narrative does maintain internal consistency regarding financial figures and business metrics, and the valuation methodology is clearly explained. However, the temporal inaccuracies and unreconciled valuation tensions significantly impact the report's coherence.",
