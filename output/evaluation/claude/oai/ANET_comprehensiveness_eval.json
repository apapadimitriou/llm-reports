    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable depth, including analyst note, business description, valuation, risks, and financials. However, it suffers from critical gaps that prevent a higher grade. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage from operating drivers to fair value outcome (showing only placeholder values $X, $Y, $Z). Sector-specific KPIs for networking equipment are largely missing from the financials snapshot - no metrics like port capacity, average selling prices, or inventory turns. Peer benchmarking is completely absent despite mentions of competitors. The report shows good sourcing discipline with consistent citations, but the incomplete valuation methodology and missing networking-specific metrics significantly undermine comprehensiveness. Some redundancy exists across sections regarding AI demand and financial strength.",
