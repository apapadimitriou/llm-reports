    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it mentions some basic causal relationships like \"record equity trading revenue up 27% amid market volatility\" and \"operating margins rising from mid-20% toward 30%\", these lack mechanistic explanation. The valuation assumes \"WACC ~8.5%\" and \"terminal growth ~2.0%\" but provides no benchmarking or justification for these critical assumptions. Revenue projections show \"mid-single-digit revenue growth (CAGR ~5%)\" without explaining the underlying drivers or methodology. The report acknowledges risks like \"tariffs could dampen growth\" but offers no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenarios. Most concerning, key assumptions are stated without support - the 8.5% WACC lacks any cost of equity calculation, and margin improvement assumptions have no operational basis. The analysis reads more like a news summary than rigorous financial analysis, failing to provide the causal mechanisms, benchmarked assumptions, or quantified sensitivities required for meaningful investment insight.",
