    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails basic comprehensiveness standards with multiple critical deficiencies. Most expected sections are present but many are skeletal or superficial. The Financials Snapshot completely lacks sector-specific KPIs for internet/tech companies (no DAU/MAU, RPU, traffic metrics, ad inventory data, or cloud ARR metrics). The valuation section mentions a $237 fair value but provides no explicit linkage from operating drivers to valuation assumptions - just vague references to 'DCF model' without showing the actual bridge from business fundamentals to value. Bulls/Bears and Risk sections largely repeat the same content with minimal new depth. While sources are provided, many claims lack proper in-text citations. The report reads more like a collection of research summaries than a comprehensive equity analysis with integrated financial modeling.",
