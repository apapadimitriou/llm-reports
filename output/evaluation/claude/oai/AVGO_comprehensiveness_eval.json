    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most major sections with reasonable depth, but has critical weaknesses that cap the grade at Fair. While semiconductor-focused KPIs like revenue growth and margins are present, the report lacks essential sector-specific metrics such as R&D spending as % of revenue, design wins, or customer concentration ratios that are standard for semiconductor analysis. The valuation section provides a $190 fair value estimate but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to valuation assumptions - it mentions revenue growth and margin assumptions but doesn't clearly bridge how AI chip demand or VMware synergies translate to the DCF inputs. Peer benchmarking is minimal (only brief P/E comparisons to Marvell). The report shows good sourcing discipline with extensive citations, covers risks comprehensively, and addresses capital allocation thoroughly. However, the missing valuation linkage and thin sector KPI coverage prevent a higher grade.",
