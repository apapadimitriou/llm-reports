    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates pervasive copying and paraphrasing from sources with virtually no original analysis. The vast majority of insights are direct restatements from Morningstar and news sources, as evidenced by extensive inline citations throughout. Key sections like Bulls/Bears Say are explicitly copied from Morningstar sources. The valuation section lacks any novel drivers beyond standard DCF assumptions sourced from Morningstar. While the report covers Microsoft comprehensively, it functions primarily as a compilation of existing research rather than providing unique analytical perspectives. No company-specific syntheses, original theses, or decision-relevant insights emerge from the analysis.",
