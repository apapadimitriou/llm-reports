    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "While the report lists some key assumptions, they are largely unjustified and contain significant internal contradictions. The revenue projections (15% CAGR through 2029, specific annual figures) and margin forecasts (operating margin declining from 55% to 45%) are stated without supporting evidence or peer comparisons. Critical valuation inputs like the 9% WACC and 4% terminal growth rate are mentioned but not justified with market data or methodology. The report contains clear contradictions: it states revenue doubled from ~$60B to $130.5B (FY2024 to FY2025) but the financials table shows FY2024 at $60B and FY2025E at $130.5B, implying these are actuals vs estimates inconsistently. Operating margins are projected to decline from 55% to 45% without explanation of competitive dynamics driving this compression. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers despite the 'Very High' uncertainty rating, automatically capping the grade at Fair, but the contradictions and weak justification push this to Poor.",
