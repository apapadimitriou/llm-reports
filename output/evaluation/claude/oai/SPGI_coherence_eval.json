    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies that fundamentally undermine its credibility. The report is dated July 2, 2025, yet cites multiple events as occurring in 2025 (Q1 2025 earnings, April 2025 announcements) that are impossible given the report's own date being in the future. The narrative contains multiple internal contradictions: it states Q1 2025 operating margin was ~50.8% while the financial table shows 2025F operating margin at only 41.0%. The Bulls/Bears section lacks proper reconciliation with the base-case valuation narrative, particularly regarding economic sensitivity concerns versus growth assumptions. Additionally, several sections read as bullet-point lists with minimal transitions, especially the Bulls/Bears and Risk sections. The extensive use of fabricated future citations and impossible dates creates a completely incoherent temporal framework that makes the analysis unreliable.",
    "evidence": [
        "Report dated 2025-07-02 cites 'Q1 2025 results' and 'April 29, 2025' events as historical facts (Analyst Note section)",
        "Contradiction between stated 'Q1 adj. op margin ~50.8%' in Bulls section versus '41.0%' for 2025F in Financials table",
        "Bears cite economic downturn risks while base case assumes steady 5-6% growth with no reconciliation of this tension"
