    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet minimum standards for quality assumptions. While some key assumptions are stated (revenue CAGR ~10%, operating margins expanding to mid-30s%, terminal growth 4%), they lack proper justification with historical data or peer benchmarks. Critical assumptions like the 9% WACC and specific growth rates are mentioned but not supported with evidence. The report contains significant internal contradictions: it states WACC is \"around 9%\" in one section but \"9.5% cost of equity and ~9% WACC\" in another, and references a \"$85 billion 2025 capex\" versus \"$75 billion\" elsewhere. Most damaging is the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers. The assumptions feel scattered and opaque, with vague justifications that don't provide the specificity needed for a credible valuation model.",
