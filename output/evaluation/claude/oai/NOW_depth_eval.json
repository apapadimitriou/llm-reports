    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some basic causal statements like \"subscription revenue was $3,113M... driven by higher yielding assets\" and \"NII was $14.6B, driven by higher yielding assets,\" the analysis lacks meaningful mechanisms explaining how ServiceNow's business actually works. The DCF model assumptions are stated (\"WACC ~8.5%\" and \"terminal growth ~3%\") but completely unanchored - no benchmarking to peers, cost of equity calculations, or industry comparisons. Revenue projections show \"gradual deceleration to high-single digits by FY2029\" with no explanation of competitive dynamics, market saturation, or customer behavior driving this pattern. The sensitivity analysis is virtually non-existent - no scenarios testing different growth rates, margin compression, or competitive threats. Risk discussion mentions \"macro uncertainty\" and \"competition\" but provides no quantified impact. The report reads like a summary of recent earnings with generic forward-looking statements rather than rigorous financial analysis.",
