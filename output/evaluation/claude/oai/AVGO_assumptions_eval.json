    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails catastrophically on assumptions quality. Key model inputs are either completely missing or vague: no explicit WACC methodology, no justification for the 3% terminal growth rate, no explanation for tax rate assumptions (\"around 10%\"), and operating margin forecasts lack supporting rationale. The revenue growth assumption of \"~12% CAGR\" is stated without detailed justification or breakdown by segment. Most critically, there are zero quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers\u2014violating the hard cap for Fair grade. Internal contradictions exist between claimed \"disciplined\" capex at 3% of revenue versus the company's massive acquisition strategy requiring substantial integration investments. The assumptions extracted are largely aspirational statements rather than specific, auditable model inputs with clear units, timeframes, and evidence-based support.",
