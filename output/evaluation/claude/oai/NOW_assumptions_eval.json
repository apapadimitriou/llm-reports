    "summary_reasoning": "The report states key assumptions but with significant weaknesses. Revenue projections (18% growth in 2025 decelerating to ~10% by 2029) lack specific justification beyond general AI adoption themes. Operating margins are assumed to stabilize at 30% without evidence-based support. The WACC of 8.5% and terminal growth of 3% are stated but not justified with market data or peer comparisons. FCF assumptions (30% of revenue) rely on limited historical trend without stress-testing. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios for any material drivers, capping the grade at Fair. The assumptions are explicit and mostly consistent internally, but justification is weak and specificity is partial.",
