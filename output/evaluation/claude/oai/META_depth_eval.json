    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides some causal mechanisms but lacks rigorous quantification and scenario analysis. Causal explanations include \"revenue up 16% year-over-year\" driven by \"resilient advertising demand and efficiency gains\" and user growth creating \"strong network effects.\" The report contains explicit valuation assumptions (\"8.5% weighted average cost of capital and a 4% terminal growth rate\") but these are not benchmarked against peers or industry standards. Revenue forecasts show \"~12% compound annual rate over 2024\u20132029\" but lack sensitivity analysis around key drivers. While counterpoints are mentioned (\"regulatory headwinds\" and \"competitive threats\"), they are not quantified into scenarios. The report states \"100 bp cut lowers NIM ~20 bps\" type analysis is absent. Implications remain generic (\"modestly overvalued in the short term\") rather than conditional on specific outcomes. The analysis falls short of rigorous quantitative scenario testing required for higher grades.",
