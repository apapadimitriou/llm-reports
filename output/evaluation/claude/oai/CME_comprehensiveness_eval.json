    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all major sections with appropriate contents structure and consistent sourcing throughout. However, it suffers from critical gaps in sector-specific KPIs for financial exchanges. The Financials Snapshot lacks essential exchange metrics like Average Daily Volume (ADV) trends, fee per contract evolution, open interest, and clearing margin requirements - providing only generic financial metrics. While valuation assumptions are stated, the linkage from operating drivers (volume growth, fee rates) to the DCF outcome lacks explicit mathematical connection. The report also misses peer benchmarking entirely and provides no scenario/sensitivity analysis. Some redundancy exists with stress test concepts repeated across sections. Despite comprehensive coverage of business fundamentals and consistent evidence citations, these structural deficiencies limit analytical depth.",
