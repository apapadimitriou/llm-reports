    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable depth but suffers from critical gaps that prevent a higher grade. While it includes comprehensive sections on business description, strategy, valuation, and ESG, it completely lacks peer benchmarking and scenario analysis. The Financials Snapshot is particularly weak, missing essential banking sector KPIs like Net Interest Margin (NIM), loan loss provisions, and detailed capital ratios beyond CET1. The valuation section provides a DCF framework but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to valuation assumptions. Sources are consistently cited throughout, but some redundancy exists across sections, particularly regarding capital strength metrics. The report demonstrates solid coverage of core content areas but the absence of banking-specific financial metrics and analytical depth limits its comprehensiveness.",
