    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies that undermine its credibility. The report is dated June 29, 2025, yet cites Q1 2025 earnings as \"recent\" results and references future years (2025-2029) as forecasts when 2025 should be current year data. Multiple sections contain abrupt topic transitions with minimal connective tissue, reading like bullet-point lists rather than coherent analysis. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing views but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation narrative, leaving contradictions unresolved. While the report demonstrates comprehensive research with extensive citations, the fundamental temporal confusion and choppy flow between sections severely compromise its coherence as a unified analytical argument.",
