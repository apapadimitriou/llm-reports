    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides some key assumptions but with significant weaknesses. Revenue growth assumptions (12% CAGR 2025-29, 10-15% annually) are stated but poorly justified - no peer benchmarks or detailed historical analysis provided. Operating margin expansion from 50% to 54-55% lacks supporting evidence. The WACC of 8.5% (mentioned in thesis) vs 9% (in valuation section) creates internal inconsistency. Terminal growth of 3% is stated without justification. Share count assumptions (~160M) appear reasonable but lack context. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers, capping the grade at Fair. The assumptions have partial specificity with units and timeframes, but justification relies heavily on general industry trends rather than rigorous analysis.",
