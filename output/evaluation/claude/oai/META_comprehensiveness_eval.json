    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid structural coverage with all major sections present and a comprehensive contents page. However, it suffers from critical weaknesses that prevent a higher grade. The Financials Snapshot lacks essential sector-specific KPIs for digital advertising companies (ARPU, DAU/MAU metrics by region, ad pricing trends, click-through rates). The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to the $400 fair value outcome - there's no clear bridge showing how user growth, engagement metrics, or ad pricing translate to the valuation. While sourcing appears consistent with 13 cited references, some key financial claims lack specific attribution. The report shows minimal redundancy and covers competitive positioning adequately, but the absence of peer benchmarking and scenario analysis limits comprehensiveness. The missing sector KPIs and weak valuation linkage trigger the Fair grade cap.",
