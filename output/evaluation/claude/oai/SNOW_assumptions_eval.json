    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without clear linkage to forecasts. While the financial table shows specific projections (20% operating margin by 2029, 22% revenue CAGR), these lack proper justification or derivation. The WACC assumption of 10% is mentioned but with an impossible 30% cost of equity that contradicts basic finance principles. Revenue growth assumptions reference management's ~$10B target by 2029 but don't explain how the specific 22% CAGR was derived. Operating margin expansion from 8% to 20% lacks benchmarking or historical analysis. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenarios testing these material drivers. The assumptions feel disconnected from the narrative, making the model essentially a black box despite the detailed financial projections.",
