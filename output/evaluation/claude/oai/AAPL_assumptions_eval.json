    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical dimensions. While some key assumptions are stated (4% revenue CAGR, 8% WACC, 2.5% terminal growth), they lack proper justification with historical data or peer benchmarks. The report contains a significant contradiction between stated 4% revenue CAGR and the actual financial projections showing ~5.0% CAGR (391B to 475B over 5 years). Most importantly, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers despite Apple's exposure to significant risks like tariffs, competition, and regulatory changes. The assumptions appear in an appendix table rather than being proximal to the forecasts they drive, reducing traceability. Operating margin expansion assumptions (31.5% to 33%) and EPS growth projections lack supporting evidence or stress-testing.",
