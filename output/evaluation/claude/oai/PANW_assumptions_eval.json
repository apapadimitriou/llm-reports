    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and poorly justified. While some key drivers are mentioned (15% FY2025 revenue growth, 7-8% terminal growth, 74-75% gross margin), they lack proper justification with historical data or peer comparisons. The WACC assumption of 9% appears in the appendix without clear derivation or sourcing. Critical assumptions like share count projections (700-710M), operating margin progression (8.5% to 15%), and terminal growth (2.5%) are stated without supporting evidence. The revenue growth assumptions contradict the company's own guidance ranges, and there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers. The forecasted operating margins show dramatic improvement without adequate justification for such operational leverage. Most assumptions are scattered across sections rather than being explicit near the forecasts they drive.",
