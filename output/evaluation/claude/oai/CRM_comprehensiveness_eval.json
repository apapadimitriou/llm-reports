    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid structural coverage with all major sections present and appropriate SaaS-focused KPIs (ARR, RPO, Data Cloud metrics). However, it suffers from significant weaknesses that prevent a higher grade. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value outcome - key assumptions like WACC components and growth rates are relegated to the appendix without clear connection to business fundamentals. Peer benchmarking is entirely absent, with only brief mentions of competitors but no comparative analysis of multiples, growth rates, or market positioning. The report exhibits notable redundancy, particularly around Agentforce deal counts and financial metrics repeated across multiple sections. While sector-appropriate KPIs are present and sourcing is generally consistent, the missing peer context and weak valuation linkage significantly undermine comprehensiveness.",
