    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable depth, but suffers from critical gaps that prevent a higher grade. While comprehensive in structure with all major sections present, it lacks essential semiconductor-specific KPIs (R&D intensity, fab utilization, ASPs, design-win metrics) that are crucial for evaluating chip companies. The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly bridge operating drivers to fair value calculation - jumping from qualitative drivers to a $165 target without showing the DCF mechanics. Peer benchmarking is completely absent despite multiple competitor references. The report demonstrates good sourcing consistency and covers regulatory risks thoroughly, but redundancy appears across sections (China export restrictions repeated in multiple areas). Financial projections extend through 2029 but lack sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling.",
