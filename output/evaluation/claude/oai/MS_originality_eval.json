    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, consisting almost entirely of copied financial data and generic restatements from cited sources. The analyst note is essentially a collection of paraphrased earnings metrics with no unique synthesis. Key insights like 'integrated platform provides diversification' and 'scale drives consistent earnings' are standard banking sector boilerplate. The valuation section offers a generic DCF with no novel drivers beyond 'mid-single-digit growth' assumptions. While the report shows extensive sourcing, it adds virtually no interpretive value beyond what's available in public filings and news. No company-specific mechanisms, catalysts with timing, or non-obvious investment theses are presented. The content reads like a compilation of press releases rather than original equity research.",
