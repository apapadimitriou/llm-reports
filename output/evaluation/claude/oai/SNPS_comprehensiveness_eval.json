    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most essential sections with appropriate structure and consistent sourcing throughout. However, it suffers from critical gaps in sector-specific KPIs for software companies (missing ARR, NRR, customer metrics, churn rates) and lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and valuation assumptions. The financials snapshot provides basic metrics but omits key SaaS/software industry KPIs that would be expected for comprehensive analysis. While peer context is mentioned (Cadence, Siemens), there's no systematic peer benchmarking with comparative metrics. The valuation section states assumptions but doesn't clearly bridge how specific operating drivers (like AI demand growth, margin expansion) translate to the $520 fair value. Some redundancy exists across sections regarding AI demand and export controls.",
