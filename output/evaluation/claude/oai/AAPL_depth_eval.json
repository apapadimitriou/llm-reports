    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally descriptive with virtually no analytical depth. While it presents extensive information about Apple, it lacks the core elements required for analytical rigor. The report provides no explicit valuation assumptions, no causal mechanisms linking drivers to outcomes, and no quantified sensitivity analysis. Key claims like \"Services segment is expanding at a double-digit clip\" and \"~4% compound annual revenue growth\" are stated without supporting logic or benchmarks. The fair value of \"$185 per share\" appears with no derivation methodology. Critical assumptions such as \"WACC of about 8%\" and \"terminal growth rate of ~2.5%\" are mentioned but never benchmarked against industry standards or stress-tested. The bulls/bears section lists factors but provides no causal analysis of how these translate to financial impact. Even when specific numbers are cited like \"tariff costs of $800 million,\" there's no analysis of how this affects margins or valuation. The report reads more like a comprehensive business overview than an analytical investment thesis with quantified scenarios and decision-relevant implications.",
