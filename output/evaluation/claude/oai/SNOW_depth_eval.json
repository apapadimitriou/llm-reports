    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some causal statements like \"Revenue grew 27% to $986.8M\" and \"driven by cross-cloud adoption and new AI feature upsells,\" these lack mechanistic explanation of how cross-cloud adoption translates to revenue growth. The DCF model presents assumptions (\"10.0% WACC,\" \"no terminal growth beyond 2029\") but provides no benchmarking or justification for these critical inputs. The sensitivity analysis is superficial (\"1% change in WACC swings PV by ~10%\") without exploring meaningful scenarios. Growth forecasts like \"~20%\u201325% growth in modestly decelerating fashion\" and margin expansion projections (\"operating margin rising from ~8% to ~20%\") are stated without underlying drivers or stress-testing. The report fails to quantify key risk scenarios or provide decision-relevant ranges, instead offering generic statements about macro risks and competition.",
