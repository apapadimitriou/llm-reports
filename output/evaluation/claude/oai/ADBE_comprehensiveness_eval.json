    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable depth and includes sector-appropriate KPIs like ARR, RPO, and ROIC. However, it suffers from significant weaknesses that prevent a higher grade. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value assumptions - key inputs like WACC (7.5%) and terminal growth (2%) are stated without justification. Peer benchmarking is completely absent, with only brief mentions of competitors like Canva without comparative analysis. The report exhibits substantial redundancy, particularly around Adobe's moat and AI concerns, which appear across multiple sections without additional depth. While financial data is comprehensive and well-sourced, the lack of scenario analysis and sensitivity testing limits analytical rigor. The extensive citation system is commendable, but these structural deficiencies cap the assessment at Fair despite strong foundational content.",
