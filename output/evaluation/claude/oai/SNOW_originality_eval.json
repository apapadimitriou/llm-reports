    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, consisting almost entirely of copied or lightly paraphrased content from sources. The analysis lacks any meaningful synthesis or original insights. Key findings include: extensive direct copying from earnings calls and press releases (e.g., exact revenue figures, retention rates, customer counts), generic boilerplate phrasing throughout ('scale & diversification,' 'secular tailwinds,' 'operating leverage'), and a standard DCF valuation with no novel drivers or mechanisms. The report reads like a compilation of public information rather than value-added analysis. No company-specific insights, unique investment theses, or decision-relevant conclusions are present. The valuation section simply applies standard assumptions without any proprietary angle or catalyst identification.",
