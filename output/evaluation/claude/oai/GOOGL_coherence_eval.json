    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency problems that prevent coherent reading. The temporal framework is fundamentally broken, with a June 2025 report date citing sources from July 2025 and claiming 'recent' Q1 2025 results. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly Bulls/Bears and Risk sections. Critical contradictions pervade the analysis: the narrative claims Google Cloud decelerated to 28% growth in Q1 while simultaneously projecting 25%+ growth going forward without reconciliation. The Bears section warns of 'ballooning expenses' from $85 billion capex while the Capital Allocation section praises this same spending as 'exemplary.' Financial projections show inconsistent margin expansion assumptions across sections. The ESG discussion contains contradictory risk assessments. While individual sections contain reasonable analysis, the report lacks connective tissue between assumptions, valuation, and risk discussions, forcing readers to construct the investment thesis themselves.",
