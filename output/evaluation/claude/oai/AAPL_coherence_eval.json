    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and content issues that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The most glaring problem is temporal confusion throughout - the report claims a 2025-06-09 date yet extensively cites future events from later in 2025, creating impossible chronology. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly the Risk section which jumps abruptly between unrelated topics. Critical contradictions emerge between sections: the Bulls section claims iPad sales are up 15% while the main narrative describes hardware softness, and the Bears section states iPhone dependence as over 50% of revenue while Business Description claims ~50%. The Fair Value section provides detailed DCF assumptions but fails to explain how these connect to the $185 estimate. Citations are frequently misaligned - sources about brand value are used to support AI development claims, and regulatory risk sources are cited for unrelated points. The writing quality is inconsistent, with some sections providing smooth analysis while others feel like hastily assembled data dumps.",
