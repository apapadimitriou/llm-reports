    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from critical deficiencies in assumption quality. Key assumptions are scattered and lack proper justification - the 9% WACC appears without derivation, terminal growth of 2.5% lacks support, and revenue growth assumptions (\"mid-single-digit\" then \"3-4%\") are vague. Multiple contradictions exist: share repurchases of \"$9.5M\" (clearly wrong magnitude), projected EPS rising from $4.0 to $4.9 (2025-2029) while the table shows different figures, and inconsistent NIM assumptions (\"~3.3%\" vs Q1 actual 3.31%). The financial table contains implausible data (2022 revenue $115B vs actual ~$89B). Most critically, there are zero quantified sensitivities despite acknowledging material risks like rate changes and credit losses. While some assumptions are explicit, the combination of contradictions, unjustified parameters, and absence of sensitivity analysis renders the model unreliable.",
