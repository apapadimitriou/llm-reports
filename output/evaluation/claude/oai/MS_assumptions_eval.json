    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet basic standards for assumption quality. Key assumptions are scattered and largely opaque\u2014the WACC of 9% appears only in the appendix without justification, terminal growth of 2% lacks support, and revenue growth projections (3-5% CAGR) are vaguely stated without specific drivers or timeframes. Critical inconsistencies undermine credibility: 2024 EPS is listed as both $8.0 and $7.95 in different sections, and expense ratios are inconsistently cited as both 70% and 71% for 2024. The efficiency ratio assumption of 'around 70%' contradicts the reported 2024 figure of 71%. Most damaging is the complete absence of sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers. While some assumptions reference historical data, the justification is weak and selective. The combination of multiple contradictions, opaque key parameters, and zero quantified sensitivities results in a model that feels like a black box.",
