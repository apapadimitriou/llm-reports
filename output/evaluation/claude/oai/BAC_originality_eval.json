    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, heavily relying on paraphrased content from cited sources with only superficial synthesis. While it presents some company-specific details (e.g., NIM of 3.31%, $3.8B technology spend), most insights are generic banking sector observations or direct restatements of public information. The report contains extensive boilerplate language about 'scale & diversification' and 'responsible growth.' The valuation section lacks novel drivers, using standard DCF assumptions without unique analytical angles. Although there are 1-2 weak attempts at synthesis (linking technology investment to efficiency, connecting stress test results to capital returns), these lack depth and specificity. The analysis fails to provide decision-relevant insights that go beyond what's readily available in earnings reports and news coverage.",
