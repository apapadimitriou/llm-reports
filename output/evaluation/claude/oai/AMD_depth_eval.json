    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some causal statements like \"revenue rose 36% year-over-year...driven by a 57% jump in data-center sales\" and \"data-center segment doubled in 2024,\" these lack mechanistic explanation. The valuation section provides basic assumptions (\"WACC ~8\u20139%,\" \"terminal growth ~3%,\" \"gross margin ~49%\") but offers no benchmarking against peers or industry standards. Critical gaps include no sensitivity analysis on key drivers, no quantified scenarios despite mentioning \"stress-test scenarios,\" and vague implications like \"fair value is about $165/share\" without conditional decision frameworks. The China export impact (\"$1.5 billion revenue shortfall\") is mentioned but not integrated into scenario modeling. Risk factors are listed descriptively rather than quantified, and the DCF methodology lacks transparency in key assumptions or ranges.",
