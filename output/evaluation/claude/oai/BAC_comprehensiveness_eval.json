    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable structure but suffers from critical gaps in banking sector KPIs and evidence quality. While all major sections are present including Analyst Note, Business Description, Valuation, Risk, and Financials Snapshot, the financial analysis lacks essential banking metrics like Net Interest Margin trends, loan loss provisions, CET1 ratios, and loan-to-deposit ratios. The valuation section fails to explicitly link operating drivers to fair value assumptions, using generic DCF parameters without clear connection to banking fundamentals. Multiple uncited claims appear throughout (e.g., share repurchase amounts, specific financial projections). The financials table uses inappropriate metrics for banking (ROIC percentages are implausibly low at 1-2%). Significant redundancy exists with stress test results mentioned repeatedly across sections without adding depth. Sources are extensive but many claims remain unsupported.",
