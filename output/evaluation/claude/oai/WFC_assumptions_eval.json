    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides some explicit assumptions but with significant weaknesses. Key assumptions like revenue CAGR (5-7%), operating margin progression (18% to 21%), WACC (9-10%), and terminal growth (2%) are stated but poorly justified. The revenue growth assumption conflicts with management's guidance of flat/declining consumer loans and only 1-3% NII growth, yet the model projects 5-6% revenue CAGR. Operating margin expansion from 18% to 21% lacks historical or peer benchmarking. The WACC calculation (10% equity cost, 20% debt at 4% yield) appears inconsistent with the stated 9-10% range. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers, capping the grade at Fair. While assumptions are generally explicit with units and timeframes, the justification relies heavily on unsupported analyst projections rather than evidence-based analysis.",
