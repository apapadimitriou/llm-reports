    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable depth but suffers from critical weaknesses that cap the grade at Fair. While all major sections are present, the Financials Snapshot is severely deficient for a bank, containing only generic metrics (Revenue, EPS, Operating Margin) and completely omitting essential banking KPIs like NIM, ROE, CET1 ratio, loan loss provisions, and book value multiples. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage from operating drivers to the $380 fair value estimate, providing only broad assumptions without showing how trading revenue assumptions or margin improvements translate to the DCF outcome. Peer benchmarking is entirely absent despite multiple references to competitive positioning. The report demonstrates good sourcing consistency and covers ESG risks appropriately, but the fundamental gaps in sector-specific analysis and valuation methodology prevent a higher grade.",
