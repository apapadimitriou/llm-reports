    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies that fundamentally undermine its credibility. The report date is July 2, 2025, yet it discusses Q1 2025 earnings as historical results and cites 2025 stress test outcomes as completed events. Multiple sections reference future events as if they already occurred, creating impossible timeline contradictions. Beyond temporal issues, the report contains significant contradictions between narrative claims and data. The Fair Value section states \"net interest income (projected steadily rising)\" and forecasts record NII growth of 6-7%, while Bears Say acknowledges rate-cut sensitivity that could compress margins. The Financials table shows implausibly low ROIC figures (1.0-2.1%) for a major bank. Additionally, structural coherence is poor with abrupt topic transitions, inconsistent terminology usage, and sections that read like disconnected bullet points rather than flowing analysis.",
