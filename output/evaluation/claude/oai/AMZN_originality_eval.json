    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains extensive content but suffers from a fundamental lack of original insights. Most analysis consists of copied/paraphrased content from sources (e.g., 'Net sales grew 9% year-over-year to $155.7 billion' directly from earnings releases) and generic restatements applicable to any large tech company ('secular growth drivers in e-commerce, cloud, and advertising'). While the report attempts one weak synthesis linking retail efficiency improvements to margin expansion, it lacks quantified mechanisms, specific catalysts, or company-distinct angles. The valuation section presents standard DCF assumptions (9% revenue CAGR, 15% terminal margins) without novel drivers or unique analytical frameworks. The extensive sourcing paradoxically highlights the report's reliance on copying rather than original analysis.",
