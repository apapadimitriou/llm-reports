    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and poorly justified. While some key drivers are mentioned (8% revenue CAGR, 45% operating margin, 9.5% WACC), they lack proper justification with historical data or peer comparisons. The revenue growth assumption of 8% annually appears inconsistent with the financials table showing 38% growth in 2023 and 12% in 2024, yet no explanation reconciles this dramatic deceleration. The 9.5% WACC is stated without supporting calculations for beta, risk-free rate, or equity premium components. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers. The report mentions 'sensitivity to WACC is \u00b1$20 per 100bp' but provides no other stress testing. Key assumptions like credit losses, loan growth rates, and NII projections are either missing or lack specificity. The forecasted margins of exactly 45% for five consecutive years (2025-2029) appear arbitrary without historical context or justification.",
