    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "This Amazon report demonstrates an overall structure but suffers from significant consistency issues and contradictory claims that prevent a higher grade. The narrative flows reasonably between sections with some connective tissue, and terminology is generally used consistently. However, multiple unresolved contradictions emerge between sections. Most notably, the Bulls/Bears section presents AWS growth deceleration and competitive pressure as major bear concerns, yet the base-case valuation narrative maintains optimistic AWS growth assumptions without reconciling this tension. The report also contains temporal inaccuracies, describing Q1 2025 results as \"recent\" when the report date is June 2025, making these 4-5 month old results no longer recent. Additionally, there are citation alignment issues where sources don't fully support the specific claims made (e.g., Prime membership numbers cited from 2021 to support current business description). While the report provides comprehensive coverage and clear language, these internal contradictions and temporal issues require readers to resolve inconsistencies themselves rather than following a cohesive argument.",
    "evidence": [
        "Bears cite AWS's 'third consecutive period of sub-20% growth' as a major concern, but the base-case valuation assumes continued 'higher growth in AWS' without addressing this deceleration risk (Bulls/Bears vs Fair Value sections)",
        "Report describes Q1 2025 earnings as part of 'recent' results when report date is June 2025, making 4-5 month old results temporally inaccurate (Analyst Note section)",
        "Prime membership figure of '200 million members' is supported by a 2021 source, not current data, creating citation misalignment (Business Description section)"
