    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that render it poorly coherent. Multiple contradictory claims appear throughout: the Bulls section cites \"127% NRR in Q3'25\" while the Analyst Note states \"~126%\" for the same metric, and the Economic Moat section provides conflicting retention ranges (\"126\u2013158%\"). The narrative contains abrupt topic jumps with minimal transitions, particularly in the Analyst Note which careens between earnings results, customer metrics, and market performance without connective tissue. Temporal accuracy is compromised by citing a \"recent\" Q3 metric in Bulls while discussing Q4 results elsewhere. The Fair Value section lacks clear linkage to the assumptions presented, jumping from growth projections to a $300 target without showing the analytical bridge. Several sections read as bullet-point lists rather than flowing arguments, especially the Risk section which presents disconnected risk factors. The Bulls/Bears arguments are not reconciled with the base-case DCF assumptions, creating unresolved tensions about growth sustainability and competitive threats.",
