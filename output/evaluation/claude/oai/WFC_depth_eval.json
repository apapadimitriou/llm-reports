    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some analytical depth but falls short of rigorous quantitative reasoning. Causal explanations are present but shallow, such as \"Net income rose 6% year-over-year to $4.89 billion on lower provisions and cost cuts\" and \"NII fell 6% to $11.50 billion amid rate cuts.\" The valuation section contains explicit assumptions including \"WACC of ~9\u201310%\" and \"2% terminal growth,\" but these lack benchmarking or justification. The model projects \"revenue rises mid\u2010single digits annually\" and \"operating margins gradually improve from ~18% in 2024 to ~21% by 2029,\" yet provides no sensitivity analysis around these key drivers. While counterpoints are mentioned through Bulls/Bears sections, they remain descriptive rather than quantified. The report states \"analysts see ~20% EPS CAGR during 2026\u201328\" but doesn't stress-test this optimistic forecast against different scenarios. Risk factors are listed but not modeled quantitatively. The fair value of $85 lacks scenario analysis or confidence intervals, limiting actionable implications for investors.",
