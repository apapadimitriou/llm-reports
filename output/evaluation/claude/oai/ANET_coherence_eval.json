    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its readability. The most critical flaw is temporal inaccuracy: the report is dated June 26, 2025, but cites Q1 2025 earnings as historical results, creating impossible chronology. Multiple contradictions plague the analysis, including claiming two customers represent both \"~35%\" and separately \"15% and 20%\" of sales. The fair value estimate is incomplete (showing \"$X.X\" placeholders), making core valuation arguments meaningless. Financial projections contain internal inconsistencies, with ROIC jumping impossibly from 28.5% to 36% between 2024-2025. Section transitions are abrupt and list-like, particularly in Bulls/Bears where points lack connective tissue. The narrative frequently jumps between topics without establishing logical flow, and key assumptions in the valuation section reference incomplete data. These fundamental structural and factual problems require readers to reconstruct the argument themselves.",
