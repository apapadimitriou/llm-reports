    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it presents extensive data and makes forecasts, it lacks meaningful causal explanations for key relationships. The few causal statements are superficial, such as \"Digital Media ARR exited Q2 at $18.09 b (up 12.1% YoY)\" without explaining growth drivers. The DCF valuation lists assumptions like \"WACC ~7.5%\" and \"2% terminal growth\" but provides no benchmarking, sensitivity analysis, or justification for these critical inputs. Growth projections show revenue declining from \"~10% annual growth slowing to ~5% by 2029\" without explaining the mechanism driving this deceleration. The report mentions competitive risks and AI monetization concerns but offers no quantified scenarios or impact analysis. Most content consists of factual summaries and management quotes rather than independent analytical reasoning about cause-and-effect relationships.",
