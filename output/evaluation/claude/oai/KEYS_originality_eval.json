    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, consisting almost entirely of copied statements from press releases and public filings. The analyst note extensively paraphrases earnings results with direct quotes and citations. The Bulls/Bears section presents generic sector-wide observations (\"technology leadership,\" \"secular tailwinds,\" \"cyclical demand weakness\") that could apply to any tech hardware company. The valuation section offers standard DCF assumptions (5-6% growth, 27-29% margins, 9% WACC) without novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. No synthesis connects multiple data points into new conclusions, and no original thesis emerges with specific catalysts or timelines. The analysis lacks decision-relevant insights beyond restating public information.",
