    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical fronts. Key assumptions are largely unstated or opaque\u2014the WACC of 9.0% lacks justification beyond vague components, terminal growth of 2.5% is mentioned without rationale, and revenue growth projections of 7-8% are unsupported by detailed analysis. Multiple contradictions exist: Agentforce deals are cited as both ~1,000 and ~3,000 paid contracts, and Data Cloud ARR growth is stated as both 120% and tripled year-over-year. The financial projections table shows specific forecasts through 2029 but the underlying drivers and methodology are completely opaque. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenarios testing material assumptions like revenue growth, margins, or discount rates. The report reads more like a business summary than a rigorous valuation model with auditable assumptions.",
