    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. Key drivers like revenue CAGR (20-25%) and operating margin expansion (21% to 28%) are stated but lack justification from historical trends or peer benchmarks. The WACC of ~10% and terminal growth of 3% are mentioned only in the appendix without supporting rationale. Multiple internal contradictions exist: FCF is reported as both $1.07B in FY2024 and FY2025, and non-GAAP EPS drops from $3.93 (FY2025) to $3.40 (FY2026F) without explanation. The financials table shows inconsistent patterns (e.g., ROIC declining from 25.8% to 24.8% then rising). No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers despite high uncertainty ratings. While some assumptions are stated with units and timeframes, the lack of justification, internal contradictions, and absence of stress-testing render the model largely unauditable.",
