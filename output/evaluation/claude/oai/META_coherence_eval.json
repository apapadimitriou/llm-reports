    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies and multiple internal contradictions that undermine its credibility. The report claims to be dated June 16, 2025, yet cites sources from future dates including June 30, 2025, which is impossible. The analyst discusses Q1 2025 results as if they occurred in the past while writing from a supposed June 2025 perspective. Major contradictions plague the financial projections: the narrative claims 2025 CapEx will be $64-72 billion, but the financials table shows only $10 billion in free cash flow for 2025, creating an impossible scenario. The report states Reality Labs lost $17.7 billion in 2024 while claiming total cumulative losses of only $69 billion through 2024, yet earlier mentions $65 billion in AI and VR investments alone. Operating margins show dramatic unexplained swings from 45% in 2024 to 40% in 2025 without adequate justification. The Bulls/Bears section fails to reconcile competitive threats with the bullish base-case projections. Additionally, several sections read as disconnected lists rather than coherent analysis, particularly the ESG and Risk sections.",
