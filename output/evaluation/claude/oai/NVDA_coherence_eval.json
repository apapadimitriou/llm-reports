    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from numerous contradictions and temporal inconsistencies that severely undermine its coherence. Most critically, the report is dated July 15, 2025, yet repeatedly cites future events as if they were historical facts. The Analyst Note references 'fiscal first-quarter 2025 results reported May 2025' and discusses July 2025 events, but the financial table shows FY2025 as an estimate rather than actual results. Revenue figures are internally contradictory - the text claims FY2025 revenue of $130.5 billion while stating Q1 2025 revenue was $44.1 billion, which would imply an impossible annualized rate. The Bulls/Bears section presents arguments that directly contradict each other without reconciliation in the base case valuation narrative. Multiple sections read like disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly the Risk section and ESG discussion. Citations frequently don't align with the claims made, and the temporal framework is fundamentally broken throughout.",
