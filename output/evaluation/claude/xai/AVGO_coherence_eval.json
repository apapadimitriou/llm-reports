    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates reasonable overall structure but suffers from several significant issues that prevent a higher grade. While the narrative arc from analysis to valuation is generally coherent, there are notable contradictions between sections that remain unaddressed. The Bulls/Bears section claims strong Q3 guidance signals sustained demand, yet the Bears section raises valid concerns about margin compression and valuation that aren't reconciled with the base-case fair value narrative. Additionally, the operating margin assumptions show inconsistency - the text states margins will expand from 35% to 38% by 2029, but the financials table shows 2024 actual margins at 36%, creating a contradiction about the starting point. The EPS bridge calculation appears flawed, starting from $4.80 and adding components totaling $1.40 but concluding at $6.20 rather than $6.20. Temporal claims are generally accurate, though some forward-looking statements lack precision. The report reads coherently in most sections but fails to address these internal contradictions, requiring readers to reconcile conflicting information themselves.",
