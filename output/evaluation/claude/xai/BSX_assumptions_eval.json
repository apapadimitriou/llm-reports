    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides key assumptions but suffers from significant weaknesses. Explicitness is partial - revenue CAGR (10%), operating margins (22% to 25%), and WACC (8.0%) are stated but scattered across sections. Justification is weak, with revenue growth based solely on one quarter's performance and margin expansion lacking historical context or peer benchmarks. Specificity is adequate for some parameters (units, timeframes) but lacks causal drivers for margin improvement. Internal consistency shows contradictions: Q2 revenue of $5.06B annualized suggests ~$20B, conflicting with forecasted $17.0B for 2025. Most critically, the report contains no quantified sensitivity analysis on any material drivers, only qualitative risk mentions, which caps the grade at Fair per instructions.",
