    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable structure, but suffers from significant deficiencies that prevent a higher rating. While key areas like Analyst Note, Business Description, Valuation, and Risk sections are present, the Financials Snapshot is severely compromised with \"Insufficient data\" entries across 4+ years of historical data, providing only FY2025 actual and forecasts. Critical sector-specific KPIs for SaaS companies are missing (Net Revenue Retention, Customer Acquisition Cost, LTV/CAC ratio). The valuation section lacks explicit mathematical linkage from operating drivers to the $500 fair value estimate. Peer benchmarking is completely absent despite mentions of competitors. Source quality is inconsistent, with one citation being vague social media posts. These gaps significantly undermine comprehensiveness despite otherwise solid coverage of business strategy and competitive positioning.",
