    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical dimensions. Key assumptions are largely unstated or opaque - the 10% revenue CAGR, 9% WACC, and margin expansion forecasts appear without proper justification or sourcing. Multiple internal contradictions exist: operating margins show as 61% in Q2 2025 text but different values in tables, and payment volume growth rates conflict across sections (8% vs varying figures). The appendix claims assumptions are 'based on 8% volume growth' but doesn't explain how this translates to 10% revenue CAGR. Most critically, there are zero quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers, despite claims that 'valuation sensitivity to +/-2% growth assumptions swinging fair value by 15%' - this sensitivity is mentioned but never actually presented. Financial forecasts span 2025-2029 but lack the granular assumptions that drive these specific projections. Sources are inadequate with multiple '[insufficient data]' references undermining credibility.",
