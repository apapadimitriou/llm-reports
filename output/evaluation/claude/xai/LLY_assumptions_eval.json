    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely deficient across all five pillars. While some key assumptions are stated in the appendix (15% revenue CAGR, 36% operating margin, 7% WACC), they lack proper justification with most claims unsupported by evidence - particularly problematic given the report acknowledges 'insufficient data' for historical financials. Specificity is weak with vague drivers like 'scale efficiencies' without quantification. Multiple internal contradictions exist: the report claims 25% endocrinology growth but shows only 15% total revenue CAGR, and states current operating margins are 32% while claiming Q2 gross margins exceeded 80%. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers, automatically capping the grade at Fair, but the combination of contradictions and poor justification results in Poor.",
