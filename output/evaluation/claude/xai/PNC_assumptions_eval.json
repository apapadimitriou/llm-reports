    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides key assumptions with moderate explicitness, listing revenue CAGR (3%), WACC (9.5%), terminal growth (2.5%), and margin targets (30% by 2029) in an appendix table. However, justification is weak - most assumptions lack historical context or peer benchmarks beyond brief mentions. Specificity is partial, with some units and timeframes provided but limited causal drivers explained. Internal consistency shows minor issues, particularly around EPS calculations and margin progression that don't fully reconcile with stated figures. Most critically, the report provides no quantified sensitivity analysis for any material drivers, only mentioning '10-15 basis points' margin compression qualitatively. The absence of robust scenarios caps the grade despite adequate assumption disclosure.",
