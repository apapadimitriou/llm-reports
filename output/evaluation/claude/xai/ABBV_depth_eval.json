    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some causal reasoning and quantified assumptions but lacks rigorous benchmarking and sensitivity analysis. Causal explanations include \"adjusted diluted EPS of $2.46, representing a 6.5% increase year-over-year\" and \"Revenue CAGR is projected at 4% from 2025-2029, driven by 10% growth in immunology offsetting flat oncology sales.\" Key assumptions are stated: \"WACC is 7.0%,\" \"terminal growth of 2%,\" and \"Operating margins are modeled at 45%.\" However, these assumptions lack industry benchmarking or stress testing. The report mentions \"valuation sensitivity of \u00b120% to revenue assumptions\" but provides no quantified scenarios. While it identifies risks like \"patent challenges\" and \"drug pricing reforms,\" it doesn't explore their financial impact. The EPS bridge attempts mechanistic reasoning but relies on insufficient historical data. Actionable implications are vague, suggesting investors \"monitor Q2 results\" without specific decision criteria or thresholds.",
