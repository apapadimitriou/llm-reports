    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates several significant structural and consistency issues that prevent it from achieving a higher grade. Most critically, there is a major temporal contradiction: the report date is listed as 2025-06-07, yet the Analyst Note discusses Q2 2025 earnings results as if they have already occurred, with sources dated August 2025. This creates fundamental confusion about the report's temporal positioning. The narrative flow suffers from abrupt transitions, particularly between the earnings discussion and strategic analysis. The Bulls/Bears section presents valid points but lacks explicit reconciliation with the base-case valuation assumptions - for instance, Bears cite supply constraints and competition risks, yet the Fair Value section projects aggressive 15% revenue CAGR without addressing these concerns. The Financial Snapshot table contains numerous 'insufficient data' entries while simultaneously providing detailed forecasts, creating inconsistency. Additionally, sections like Business Description and ESG Risk read as bullet-point summaries with minimal connective tissue. While the report contains substantive analysis and the valuation methodology is clearly explained, these structural flaws and contradictions significantly impair coherence and require readers to piece together the argument themselves.",
