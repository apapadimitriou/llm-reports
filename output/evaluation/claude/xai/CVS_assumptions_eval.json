    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical dimensions. Key assumptions are largely unstated or opaque - revenue growth rates, margin expansion drivers, WACC components, and terminal growth lack proper justification. The 5% revenue CAGR is mentioned but not broken down by segment with supporting evidence. Operating margin expansion from 4.5% to 5.2% is asserted without detailing specific cost control measures or efficiency gains. The WACC of 7.5% appears with minimal justification (beta 0.9, cost of debt 4.0%) but lacks market data or peer comparisons. Most critically, there are zero quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers, automatically capping the grade at Fair. Additionally, internal contradictions exist: projected 2025 cash flow drops from $9.1B (2024) to $7.0B (2025) without explanation, while simultaneously projecting growth. The assumptions table in the appendix is sparse and provides rationale that is circular rather than evidence-based.",
