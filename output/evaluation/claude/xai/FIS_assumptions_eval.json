    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit assumptions with specific numerical values and timeframes, particularly in the Fair Value section and Appendix table. However, the justification is weak - most assumptions rely on vague references to 'Q2 2025 trends' without detailed historical analysis or peer benchmarking. The WACC of 8.5% is labeled as 'sector average' without supporting data. While assumptions are internally consistent across tables and narrative, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rules. The report mentions risks could 'swing valuation by 20-30%' but provides no quantified sensitivity ranges for key inputs like revenue growth, margins, or WACC changes.",
