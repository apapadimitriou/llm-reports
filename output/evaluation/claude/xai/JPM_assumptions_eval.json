    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and poorly justified. Key drivers like the 4% revenue CAGR, 9% WACC, and margin expansion to 38% are stated without meaningful support. The WACC calculation appears internally inconsistent (3% risk-free rate + 6% equity risk premium \u2260 9% with beta 1.1). Multiple assumptions lack specificity, with frequent 'insufficient data' disclaimers undermining credibility. While some assumptions are explicitly listed in the appendix, they lack proper justification beyond vague references. No quantified sensitivities are provided\u2014only a qualitative mention of '100bps cut potentially reducing earnings by 5-10%' without modeling details. The report contains internal contradictions between stated confidence in assumptions and repeated acknowledgments of missing data. Overall, the assumptions feel scattered and unreliable for investment decision-making.",
