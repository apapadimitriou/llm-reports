    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and substantive deficiencies that render it incoherent as an equity research piece. The most glaring issue is the complete absence of quantitative data throughout - every financial table shows 'N/A' and core valuation sections admit 'insufficient data.' This creates a fundamental contradiction: the report purports to be equity research while providing no financial analysis or investment recommendation. The narrative sections read like disconnected summaries of press releases rather than analytical content, with abrupt topic jumps and minimal transitions. The Bulls/Bears section exemplifies this, with bears citing 'insufficient data' as evidence points rather than actual risks. Temporal issues compound the problems - the report date of July 2025 references future events from August 2025 as 'recent announcements,' creating logical impossibilities. Cross-references between sections are virtually nonexistent, making each section feel isolated. The repeated acknowledgment of data limitations throughout undermines any analytical credibility, while the narrative fails to build toward any coherent investment thesis or recommendation.",
