    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards despite having a complete contents page. Multiple critical biotechnology KPIs are entirely missing from the Financials Snapshot (no pipeline metrics, R&D productivity ratios, clinical trial success rates, or regulatory milestone tracking). The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value outcome, with assumptions presented in isolation. Peer benchmarking is completely absent throughout all sections. Evidence quality is severely compromised with multiple admissions of insufficient data, extrapolated figures, and outdated information. The report contains substantial redundancy, repeating cost-cutting initiatives and pipeline timelines across multiple sections without adding depth. For a biotechnology company, the absence of sector-specific analytical frameworks renders this report fundamentally incomplete.",
