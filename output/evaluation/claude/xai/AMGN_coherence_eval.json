    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal contradictions and structural incoherence that fundamentally undermine its credibility. The report date is July 2, 2025, yet it claims to analyze Q2 2025 results that supposedly occurred in the future, with sources dated August 2025 - creating impossible temporal relationships. The narrative contains multiple unresolved contradictions: it states Q2 EPS was $6.02 then projects 2025 EPS at $20.50 (implying only $2.46 for remaining quarters), claims 9% revenue growth signals strength while acknowledging margin pressures and stock declines, and presents conflicting views on operating costs without reconciliation. The Bulls/Bears section lists concerns like higher costs and stock decline but fails to integrate these with the overwhelmingly positive base-case narrative. Transitions between sections are abrupt, with the Business Strategy jumping from manufacturing to obesity treatments without logical flow. The financial table is mostly empty ('insufficient data'), yet the valuation model claims precision with specific assumptions. Citations appear fabricated given the temporal impossibilities, and terminology usage is inconsistent throughout.",
    "evidence": [
        "Report dated 2025-07-02 analyzing 'Q2 2025 results' with sources from August 2025 - temporally impossible",
        "Claims Q2 EPS of $6.02 but projects full-year 2025 EPS at $20.50, mathematically inconsistent across sections",
        "Bears cite 'higher operating costs' and 'stock declined post-earnings' but base-case maintains 'cautious optimism' without reconciling these concerns"
