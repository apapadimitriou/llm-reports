    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and factual coherence problems that prevent it from reading as a connected argument. Most critically, the report claims a June 29, 2025 report date while citing sources from August 2025, creating impossible temporal contradictions. The narrative contains multiple unresolved contradictions: it states Q2 2025 profits were $3.72 billion while simultaneously claiming 'insufficient data' for current stock price and market cap. The fair value estimate of $520 lacks proper derivation - the DCF model claims specific assumptions (4% revenue CAGR, 30% margins, 9% WACC) but the math connecting these to $520 is never shown. Bulls/Bears sections list generic points without reconciling rate sensitivity concerns with the base case of 'steadily rising' performance. The financials table is essentially empty, stating 'insufficient data' for all historical periods while making precise forecasts. Sources are problematic, mixing social media posts with official company pages, and some URLs appear fabricated. Sections read like disconnected bullet points with minimal transitions, forcing readers to construct the investment thesis themselves.",
