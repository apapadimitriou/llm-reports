    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all major sections with appropriate structure and sourcing, but suffers from critical deficiencies that cap the grade at Fair. While comprehensive in scope, it lacks sector-specific KPIs essential for electronic test and measurement companies (no R&D intensity metrics, gross margins by segment, or order backlog data). The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly bridge operating drivers to the $175 fair value outcome. Peer benchmarking is superficial, mentioning competitors without meaningful comparative analysis. The financials snapshot is generic, missing key industry metrics like book-to-bill ratios and segment-level margins. Some redundancy exists across sections regarding AI/6G trends. Sources are inconsistent with future dates (2025-07-27, 2025-08-06) undermining credibility. Despite good coverage of moat, risks, and capital allocation, these structural gaps prevent a higher rating.",
