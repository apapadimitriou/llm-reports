    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. Critical banking sector KPIs are entirely absent from the Financials Snapshot (no NIM, loan loss provisions, CET1 ratio, or loan growth metrics). Multiple material claims lack proper citations, with excessive reliance on vague '[assumed]' notations and insufficient data disclaimers. The valuation section provides basic DCF assumptions but fails to explicitly bridge operating drivers to fair value outcomes. Peer benchmarking is completely missing despite brief mentions. The report demonstrates significant redundancy, repeating charge-off rates and data analytics advantages across multiple sections without adding depth. Sources are generic and lack specific data points, undermining credibility. While structural sections are present, the thin analytical depth, missing sector-specific metrics, and poor evidence integration render this report fundamentally incomplete for institutional equity research standards.",
