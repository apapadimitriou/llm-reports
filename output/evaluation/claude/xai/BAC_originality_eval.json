    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly restated information with minimal original synthesis. While it attempts to connect Q2 2025 results to forward outlook, most insights are generic banking analysis that could apply to any major bank. The report presents standard DCF assumptions without novel drivers, relies heavily on boilerplate phrasing about 'scale and diversification,' and offers limited company-specific angles. The valuation section lacks innovative mechanisms beyond basic revenue/margin projections. Only one weak synthesis emerges around digital engagement trends, but this lacks quantified implications or specific catalysts. The analysis falls short of providing unique, decision-relevant perspectives that go beyond paraphrasing earnings results and standard banking metrics.",
