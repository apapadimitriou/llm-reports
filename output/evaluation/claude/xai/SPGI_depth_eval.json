    "summary_reasoning": "This report provides some causal mechanisms and explicit assumptions but lacks depth in critical areas. Causal explanations appear in fragments like \"Revenue growth was driven by demand for data analytics\" and \"margin expansion from cost synergies,\" but these lack specificity about underlying drivers. The report states explicit assumptions including \"WACC is estimated at 8%\" and \"Terminal growth of 4%\" with basic rationales, but provides no benchmarking against peers or industry standards. Quantification exists in forecasts (\"8% revenue CAGR\" and \"Operating margins expand from 42% to 45%\") but without supporting analysis of achievability. The EPS bridge attempts mechanistic reasoning but remains superficial. Most critically, sensitivity analysis is minimal\u2014only mentioning \"fair value sensitivity of \u00b120%\" without scenarios. The report acknowledges \"Regulatory risks involve antitrust scrutiny\" but fails to quantify impacts or explore alternative outcomes meaningfully.",
