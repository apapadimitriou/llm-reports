    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies and internal contradictions that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The most glaring issue is the report date of June 29, 2025, yet it references Q2 2025 earnings reported on July 16 and multiple August 2025 events, creating impossible temporal claims. The dividend announcement supposedly occurred on July 3, 2025, but is treated as historical fact in a June report. Additionally, there are significant contradictions between narrative claims and financial data: the text states 'revenue growth at 3-4% annually through 2027' while the financials table shows declining revenue from 2023A ($21.5B) to 2024A ($21.0B), then only modest growth. Operating margins show dramatic inconsistencies, with the narrative claiming improvement 'from 26% in 2024 due to cost controls' while the table shows margins declining from 32% (2022) to 26% (2024). The EPS bridge calculation is internally inconsistent, starting from $12.50 and adding components to reach $13.80, but this doesn't align with the table's $13.8 figure derivation. Bulls/Bears points reference future events as if they're past occurrences, and sections read as disconnected bullet points with minimal transitional logic.",
