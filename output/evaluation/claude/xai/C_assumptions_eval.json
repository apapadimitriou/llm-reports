    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The assumptions are largely opaque and poorly justified. While some key drivers are stated (5% revenue CAGR, 30% operating margins by 2029, 9% WACC), they lack proper justification beyond vague references to 'Q2 2025 trends' and 'transformation efficiencies.' The report contains multiple contradictions: operating margins show 28% in 2022, drop to 24% in 2023, yet are projected to reach 30% by 2029 without clear explanation; EPS drops from $7.00 to $4.00 between 2022-2023 but is forecast to reach $10.00 by 2029 with insufficient bridging logic. The WACC assumption of 9% uses a beta of 1.2 and 3% risk-free rate without current market justification. Revenue growth projections of 5% CAGR lack segment-specific support despite mentioning 7% services growth and 4% markets growth. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers, making the $70 fair value estimate appear as a black box. The margin expansion assumption of +5 percentage points relies solely on unspecified 'transformation efficiencies' without historical precedent or peer benchmarking.",
