    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with a clear structure, but suffers from significant depth and evidence issues that prevent a higher grade. While all major sections are present, the content lacks sector-specific KPIs critical for social media/tech companies (MAU growth rates, ARPU by region, ad load metrics). The financials snapshot is generic, missing key metrics like user engagement rates, monetization efficiency, and geographic revenue breakdowns. Evidence integration is inconsistent with multiple \"insufficient data\" disclaimers and uncited claims. The valuation section provides basic DCF assumptions but lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and valuation outcomes. Peer benchmarking is superficial, limited to brief ESG comparisons. The report demonstrates reasonable coverage breadth but insufficient analytical depth and rigor expected for comprehensive equity research.",
