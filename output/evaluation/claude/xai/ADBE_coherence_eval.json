    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies and multiple internal contradictions that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The report date is June 13, 2025, but references events from August 2025 as historical facts, creating impossible temporal sequences. Critical contradictions include claiming Q2 FY25 results were released on June 12, 2025 while simultaneously citing Q2 FY24 share buyback data from 2024. The narrative contains inconsistent financial data - operating margins are stated as expanding from 35% in FY24 to 48% by FY29, but the financials table shows only 35.0% to 48.0% progression without explaining the gap. Bulls/Bears section fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base case valuation. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet points without smooth transitions. Source citations are frequently inadequate, with several marked as 'insufficient data' or referencing vague 'posts found on X.' The EPS bridge calculation appears fabricated, starting from $18.00 and adding arbitrary amounts. These fundamental flaws force readers to reconstruct the argument independently rather than following a coherent analytical framework.",

        "Report dated June 13, 2025 references 'stock declining 36.93% over past year as of mid-August 2025' - impossible temporal sequence",

        "Multiple sources marked 'Insufficient data' including key ESG scores and market share claims - inadequate citation support"
