    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes most expected sections with a complete contents page, but suffers from critical deficiencies that cap the grade at Fair. The Financials Snapshot is severely compromised with 'insufficient data' for all historical figures and lacks essential SaaS sector KPIs like ARR, NRR, and customer metrics. The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to the $300 fair value outcome. Evidence citations are inconsistent, with some claims unsourced and reliance on informal sources like 'Posts found on X'. The report shows redundancy with cRPO growth figures repeated across sections without adding new depth. While peer benchmarking and scenario analysis are completely absent, the structure demonstrates reasonable coverage of core topics with proportional depth in most areas.",
