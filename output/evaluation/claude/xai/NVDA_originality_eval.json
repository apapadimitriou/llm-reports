    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates extremely low originality with pervasive copying and generic restatements. Multiple insights are directly copied from sources or social media posts without attribution (e.g., specific financial figures, margin estimates, sentiment observations). The analysis consists primarily of boilerplate observations applicable to any semiconductor company ('leadership in GPU technology,' 'secular growth in AI'). The fair value estimate of $227.95 is explicitly copied from analyst consensus with zero original analysis. The report contains no synthesis connecting multiple data points, no original thesis with mechanisms or catalysts, and no company-specific insights beyond restating public earnings data. Red flags include extensive use of 'insufficient data' disclaimers, generic DCF framework with no novel drivers, and heavy reliance on unattributed social media sentiment. The content lacks any decision-relevant analysis that would help investors understand Nvidia's unique positioning or trajectory.",
