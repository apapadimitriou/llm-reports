    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some company-specific detail but falls short of meaningful synthesis. While it provides specific numbers (Q1 EPS $2.60 vs $2.20 estimate, 40% wealth management revenue contribution), most insights are generic restatements applicable to any investment bank. The transformation thesis around E*Trade/Eaton Vance acquisitions and wealth management diversification is a weak synthesis but lacks novel mechanisms or catalysts. The valuation section uses standard DCF assumptions without unique drivers. Red flags include boilerplate phrasing ('scale & diversification,' 'competition from fintech disruptors') and generic insights about investment banking recovery that could apply sector-wide. The report copies language from Reuters sources and presents standard margin expansion assumptions. Only 1-2 insights show weak synthesis, with most being generic restatements, capping the grade at Fair per the hard caps.",
