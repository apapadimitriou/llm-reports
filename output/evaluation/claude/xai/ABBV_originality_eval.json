    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic restatements and copied content with minimal original synthesis. While it attempts some company-specific analysis around Humira patent cliff dynamics and pipeline transitions, most insights are standard pharmaceutical sector observations applicable to any large biopharma company. The valuation section relies on conventional DCF modeling without novel drivers or mechanisms. Key red flags include boilerplate phrases like 'aging populations driving demand' and 'high switching costs in chronic disease treatments.' The EPS bridge and revenue projections lack unique analytical angles beyond basic growth assumptions. Only 1-2 weak syntheses appear regarding the Skyrizi/Rinvoq transition offsetting Humira declines, but these lack quantified causal mechanisms or specific catalysts beyond generic timelines.",
