    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic restatements and boilerplate analysis with minimal originality. While it presents some company-specific data points (Q1 2025 results, AWS margins, advertising growth), these are largely copied from earnings reports without meaningful synthesis. The valuation section relies on standard DCF methodology with no novel drivers or mechanisms. Key insights like 'scale advantages,' 'network effects,' and 'flywheel dynamics' are generic banking on well-known Amazon characteristics. The report fails to provide unique investment theses, specific catalysts with timing, or non-obvious connections between data points. Most analysis could apply to any large tech company. The few attempts at forward-looking commentary lack quantified mechanisms or actionable insights beyond restating guidance figures.",
