    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report shows some mechanisms and assumptions but lacks depth and rigor. Causal explanations are present but shallow: \"driven by strength in key product lines\" and \"cost savings of $800 million annually from restructuring\" provide basic causality without detailed mechanisms. Assumptions are explicit with \"4% revenue CAGR from 2025-2029\" and \"WACC is 8.5%\" but lack benchmarking or justification. The \"Terminal growth is 2%\" assumption cites \"Long-term biotech industry average\" but provides no supporting data. Quantification exists in forecasts and valuation but sensitivity analysis is completely absent. The report mentions \"swing valuation by 20-30%\" for operational risks but provides no scenarios or stress tests. Actionable implications are vague, offering only a \"hold recommendation\" without conditional decision frameworks tied to specific outcomes or thresholds.",
