    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that fundamentally undermine its coherence. Multiple temporal contradictions exist, with sources dated August 2025 (future dates) being cited as current events in a report dated April 2025. The narrative contains unresolved contradictions between bullish volume growth projections and acknowledged trading headwinds. The valuation section exhibits mathematical inconsistencies, claiming 9% revenue CAGR while showing different growth rates in calculations (Q1 revenue of $1.6B annualized doesn't align with forecasted figures). Critical sections like Economic Moat and ESG repeatedly state 'insufficient data' while still making definitive claims. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing views without reconciliation in the base-case narrative. Transitions between sections are abrupt, with paragraphs reading like disconnected bullet points rather than flowing arguments. The report fails to establish clear connective tissue between assumptions, valuation methodology, and risk factors, forcing readers to piece together the investment thesis independently.",
