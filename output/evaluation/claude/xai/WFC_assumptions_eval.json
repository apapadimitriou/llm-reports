{
    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from severely opaque assumptions and multiple internal contradictions. Key assumptions are scattered without clear justification - the 4% revenue CAGR relies on vague 'growth post-asset cap' without quantification, while the 9% WACC lacks any supporting calculation or market data. The EPS bridge contains a fundamental mathematical error: starting from $5.61 and adding net $0.60 cannot yield $7.50. Historical data is almost entirely missing ('insufficient data' throughout financials table), making peer/historical justification impossible. The 28% operating margin target has no benchmark support. Most critically, there are zero sensitivity analyses on any material drivers - no scenarios for rate changes, credit losses, or economic conditions despite acknowledging these as key risks. The assumptions appear more like placeholder estimates than rigorous financial modeling.",
