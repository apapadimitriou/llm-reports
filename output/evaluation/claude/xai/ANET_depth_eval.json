    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some causal reasoning with mechanisms like \"revenue reaching a record level and a 30.4% year-over-year increase, driven by robust demand\" and \"EPS bridge: FY2025 EPS of $9.50 builds from FY2024's estimated $8.00, with $1.50 from revenue growth.\" However, the analysis is severely hampered by pervasive data gaps marked as \"insufficient data\" throughout critical sections. While explicit assumptions exist (\"20% revenue CAGR,\" \"WACC is 9.0%,\" \"Terminal Growth Rate 4.0%\"), they lack proper benchmarking or industry context. The report mentions sensitivity briefly (\"2% WACC change swings valuation by 20%\") but provides no comprehensive scenario analysis. Counterpoints are superficial, limited to generic \"Bears Say\" points without quantified impacts. The frequent \"insufficient data\" disclaimers and lack of robust sensitivity testing prevent this from reaching a higher grade despite some analytical elements being present.",
