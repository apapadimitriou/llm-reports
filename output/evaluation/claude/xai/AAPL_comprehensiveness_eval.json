    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all major sections with detailed content and proper structure, but suffers from critical deficiencies that prevent a higher grade. While comprehensive in scope, it lacks sector-specific KPIs essential for technology equity research (no ARR, user growth metrics, or device unit sales data). The financials snapshot is generic, missing crucial technology sector metrics. Multiple claims lack proper citations, including specific revenue figures and growth projections marked as 'insufficient data.' The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly bridge operating drivers to the $245 fair value calculation. Sources include questionable references like 'Posts found on X' and inferred data points, undermining credibility. Despite thorough coverage of business strategy, moat analysis, and risk assessment, these fundamental gaps in sector-appropriate metrics and evidence standards cap the grade at Fair.",
