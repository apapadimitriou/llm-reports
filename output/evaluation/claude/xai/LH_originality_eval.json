    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits fundamental deficiencies in originality and analytical depth. The analysis consists almost entirely of generic restatements and copied content from sources, with no meaningful synthesis or original insights. Key findings include: 1) The analyst note merely paraphrases Q2 earnings results without adding interpretive value, 2) Business strategy section offers boilerplate observations about 'leveraging scale' and 'aging populations' that apply to any diagnostics company, 3) Bulls/Bears points directly restate basic financial metrics without analysis, 4) Valuation section is completely absent due to 'insufficient data' excuse, and 5) All substantive content is either copied from IR materials or represents generic sector commentary. The report fails to provide any company-specific insights, causal mechanisms, or decision-relevant analysis that would help investors understand Labcorp's unique positioning or investment merit.",
