    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with a complete contents page, but exhibits significant weaknesses that prevent a higher grade. While major sections are present, the Financials Snapshot is severely compromised with 'insufficient data' entries across critical historical periods and lacks sector-specific KPIs essential for pharmaceutical analysis (R&D spending ratios, drug approval metrics, pipeline value). The valuation section attempts to link drivers to outcomes but relies heavily on assumptions marked as 'insufficient data,' undermining credibility. Evidence citations are inconsistent, with multiple claims unsupported by proper sources. Redundancy is evident with Q1 results repeated across Analyst Note and other sections without additional depth. The peer benchmarking context is largely absent, and scenario analysis is missing entirely.",
