    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some analytical depth but falls short of rigorous standards. Causal explanations are present but shallow: \"non-GAAP operating margin expanding to 30.5% from 27.8% a year ago, aided by operational efficiencies and scale\" links margin improvement to scale but lacks specificity. The DCF model includes explicit assumptions like \"WACC of 9.0%\" and \"five-year revenue CAGR of 20%\" but these are poorly benchmarked\u2014the WACC components appear generic and revenue projections lack industry context. Quantification exists throughout: \"EPS bridge: Starting from FY2024 EPS of $12.50\" and \"forward P/E of 50x\" but sensitivity analysis is minimal. The report mentions \"Macroeconomic slowdowns could extend sales cycles\" and \"potentially reducing revenue by 5-10%\" as counterpoints but doesn't explore scenarios systematically. While implications are stated, they remain somewhat vague rather than providing clear, conditional guidance for different market conditions.",
