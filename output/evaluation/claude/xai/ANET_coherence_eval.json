    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "This report demonstrates significant structural and consistency issues that undermine its coherence. The narrative contains multiple internal contradictions, most notably in the fair value estimate which is stated as both $500 (raised from $450) and $450 in different sections. The temporal framework is problematic, with the report dated August 10, 2025, making references to Q2 2025 results as historical fact. The analysis suffers from pervasive data gaps marked as 'insufficient data' throughout key sections, creating an incomplete foundation. While the overall structure exists with clear section headers, many sections read as bullet-point lists with minimal transitions. The Bulls/Bears section lacks reconciliation with the base-case valuation narrative, particularly regarding competition and concentration risks. Citations are numerous but don't always align with claims made. The financial projections appear internally consistent within the table but lack proper justification in the narrative. Despite some strengths in technical analysis and comprehensive coverage, the contradictions and structural weaknesses significantly impair the report's coherence.",
