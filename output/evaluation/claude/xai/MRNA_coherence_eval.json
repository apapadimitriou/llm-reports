    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its credibility. Most critically, there are glaring temporal contradictions: the report date is July 1, 2025, yet it discusses Q2 2025 earnings as historical events and cites sources from August 2025 - a logical impossibility. The financial projections contain massive inconsistencies, showing operating margins swinging wildly from +50% to -200% to +15% without adequate explanation for such extreme volatility. Revenue forecasts project dramatic declines followed by aggressive recovery with insufficient justification. The narrative flow is choppy with abrupt topic changes, particularly in the Analyst Note section which jumps between financial metrics, pipeline updates, and strategic outlook without clear transitions. Multiple sections read like bullet-point lists rather than coherent analysis. The Bulls/Bears section presents conflicting views but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation assumptions. Source citations are problematic, including references to non-financial publications and disclaimers about insufficient data while still presenting specific figures. The ESG section acknowledges missing data yet provides specific ratings. These fundamental flaws in temporal logic, internal consistency, and narrative structure require readers to construct the argument themselves.",
