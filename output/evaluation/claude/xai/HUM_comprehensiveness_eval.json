    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with a comprehensive contents page and addresses key areas like business description, valuation, and risks. However, it suffers from critical deficiencies that cap the grade at Fair. The Financials Snapshot lacks essential healthcare sector KPIs (MLR, medical membership, premium per member), containing only generic metrics. Multiple claims are unsupported or based on vague sourcing ('insufficient data', 'model-derived'). The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to create an explicit bridge from operating drivers to the $410 fair value outcome. Peer benchmarking is superficial, limited to brief mentions without systematic comparison. Some redundancy exists across sections, particularly regarding Q2 results and MA market positioning.",
