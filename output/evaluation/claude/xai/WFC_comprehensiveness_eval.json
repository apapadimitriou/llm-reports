    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails basic comprehensiveness standards with critical deficiencies across multiple areas. The Financials Snapshot is severely inadequate, showing only 'insufficient data' for all historical periods and lacking essential banking KPIs like NIM, loan loss provisions, CET1 ratios, and loan growth metrics. The valuation section provides no explicit linkage between operating drivers and the $65 fair value estimate, merely stating assumptions without showing calculations or bridges. Peer benchmarking is completely absent despite this being fundamental for bank analysis. Multiple claims lack proper citations, including the specific Q2 revenue figures and EPS projections. The report contains internal inconsistencies, such as discussing Q2 2025 results while showing a June 2025 report date, and references insufficient data throughout while making definitive projections. These fundamental gaps make the report incomplete and unreliable for investment analysis.",
