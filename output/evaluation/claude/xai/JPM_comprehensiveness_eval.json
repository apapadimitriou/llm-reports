    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. Critical banking sector KPIs are systematically missing from the Financials Snapshot, including NIM, loan loss provisions, deposit growth rates, and loan-to-deposit ratios. The report repeatedly uses \"insufficient data\" placeholders throughout, indicating incomplete analysis. Valuation methodology lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value calculation - the DCF model mentions a $220 target but provides no detailed cash flow projections or sensitivity analysis. Sources are inconsistent, mixing credible outlets with vague \"Posts found on X\" citations. Multiple sections contain unsupported claims with no backing data. The report structure exists but content depth is severely lacking, with generic statements replacing sector-specific analysis expected for a major bank.",
