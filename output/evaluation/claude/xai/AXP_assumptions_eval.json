    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from severe contradictions and lacks quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers. Multiple internal inconsistencies undermine credibility: Q1 2025 results are presented as factual despite the report date being 2025-06-29, making future Q1 results impossible. The EPS bridge calculation is mathematically incorrect ($12.50 + $1.00 + $0.50 - $0.25 = $13.75, not $15.00). While key assumptions like 8% revenue CAGR, 8.5% WACC, and 4% terminal growth are explicitly stated with some justification, the report provides only qualitative sensitivity mentions (e.g., '50 basis points delinquency increase' and '15% valuation swing') without systematic quantified scenarios for all material drivers. The combination of multiple contradictions plus absence of robust sensitivity analysis triggers the 'Poor' grade per the hard caps, despite reasonable explicitness and partial justification of core assumptions.",
