    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally incomplete and superficial across all major sections. While it contains the expected section headers, the content is skeletal with pervasive \"insufficient data\" disclaimers throughout. Critical semiconductor sector KPIs are entirely missing (GPU shipment volumes, data center vs gaming revenue breakdown, R&D as % of revenue, fab capacity utilization). The valuation section provides only an analyst consensus target with zero methodology, completely failing to link operating drivers to valuation assumptions. Financial forecasts are non-existent beyond one quarter of actual results. The report relies heavily on uncited social media sentiment (\"from X posts\") rather than credible financial data. Most sections like Economic Moat, Capital Allocation, and ESG contain no substantive analysis. The extensive use of \"insufficient data\" across financials, competitive positioning, and risk quantification makes this report unsuitable for investment decision-making.",
