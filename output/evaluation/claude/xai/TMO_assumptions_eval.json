    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails catastrophically on all five pillars of assumption quality. Explicitness: The report explicitly states 'insufficient data' for virtually every key valuation assumption including revenue CAGR, margins, WACC, and terminal growth. Justification: No evidence is provided for any financial assumptions because none are made. Specificity: The Key Valuation Assumptions Table shows 'insufficient data' for all critical drivers with no units, horizons, or magnitudes provided. Consistency: While there are no direct contradictions, this is only because no substantive assumptions exist to contradict. Sensitivity: No sensitivity analysis whatsoever is provided. The report acknowledges it 'cannot proceed without qualifying sources' for financial forecasts, yet still attempts to provide investment analysis. This represents a fundamental failure to meet basic equity research standards where assumptions should drive valuations and conclusions.",
