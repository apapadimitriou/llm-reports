    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails fundamental assumption quality standards through multiple critical flaws. Key assumptions are scattered and poorly justified\u2014revenue CAGR of 12% lacks proper support beyond vague 'transaction growth trends,' while the 8.5% WACC appears arbitrary with no derivation shown. A major contradiction exists between claimed 'mid-teens revenue growth through 2029' in text versus 12% CAGR in tables. The EPS bridge contains unexplained figures ($1.50 from revenue growth, $0.90 from margin expansion) without methodology. Operating margin forecasts (56% to 58.5%) lack peer benchmarking or historical justification. Most damaging is the complete absence of sensitivity analysis\u2014no quantified scenarios for any material drivers despite claims of 'medium uncertainty.' The terminal growth rate of 4% and beta of 1.0 are stated without support. While some assumptions are explicit, the combination of internal contradictions, weak justification, and zero stress-testing renders the model unauditable and unreliable.",
