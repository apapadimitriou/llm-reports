    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from critical contradictions and lacks proper sensitivity analysis. A major contradiction exists in the financials table where 2024A revenue is listed as $3580.0B (impossible given historical context and other figures). Key assumptions like 12% revenue CAGR, 33% terminal operating margin, and 8.5% WACC are stated but weakly justified with vague references to trends. While some assumptions are explicit with specific magnitudes and timeframes, justification relies heavily on hand-wavy references to unspecified trends from earnings calls. No quantified sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers - only qualitative risk mentions. The EPS bridge methodology is shown but built on questionable base figures. Multiple assumptions reference generic 'trends' without specific supporting data or peer comparisons.",
