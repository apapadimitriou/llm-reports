    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some analytical depth but falls short of rigorous standards. Causal explanations are present but shallow, such as \"Q1 performance was bolstered by strong sales in oncology and immunology\" and \"operational growth excluding the vaccine was robust, aligning with secular trends.\" The EPS bridge shows quantified assumptions: \"adding $0.62 from revenue growth, $0.25 from margin expansion, offset by $0.05 from higher taxes.\" However, key assumptions lack benchmarking - the \"WACC estimated at 7.0%\" and \"terminal growth rate of 3.0%\" are stated without industry comparisons or justification. The report mentions risks like \"inflation impacting supply chains\" but provides no sensitivity analysis or quantified scenarios. While implications exist (\"hold recommendation\"), they lack conditional frameworks tied to specific outcomes or ranges.",
