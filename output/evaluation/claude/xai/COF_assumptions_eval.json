{
    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely deficient across all quality dimensions. Key assumptions are largely unstated or marked as 'assumed' without justification - revenue CAGR of 5%, margin expansion to 25%, and WACC of 9% appear without supporting evidence. Multiple internal contradictions exist: operating margins show 25% in 2022 but target 25% by 2029 (no improvement), and EPS calculations don't reconcile with stated figures. The report admits 'insufficient data' repeatedly while making specific forecasts. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers. Most critically, assumptions are scattered throughout without proximity to forecasts, lack units/timeframes, and rely on vague references to numbered sources that don't support the specific figures used. The combination of opaque assumptions, multiple contradictions, and complete absence of stress-testing renders this analysis fundamentally unreliable.",
