    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some causal reasoning but lacks analytical rigor. While it provides mechanisms like \"NGS ARR grew 37% to $4.8 billion, reflecting robust demand for cloud security\" and \"Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 28.5%... supported by operational efficiencies,\" the analysis remains shallow. The DCF model includes explicit assumptions (\"WACC is 9.5%,\" \"Terminal growth 4%,\" \"revenue CAGR of 13%\") but these are not benchmarked against peers or industry standards. The report mentions \"EPS bridge: FY2025 base EPS $5.50, plus $0.80 from margin gains\" showing some quantification, but provides minimal sensitivity analysis beyond vague statements like \"swing valuation by 20-30%.\" Counterpoints exist in the Bears Say section but lack depth. The fair value derivation of $195 uses standard multiples but without stress-testing key assumptions or exploring alternative scenarios meaningfully.",
