    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with appropriate structure, but suffers from critical deficiencies that prevent a higher grade. The Financials Snapshot is severely compromised with 'insufficient data' for all historical years (2022-2024), providing only forward-looking projections without baseline context. Sector-specific KPIs for pharmaceuticals are largely missing - no R&D spending ratios, pipeline value metrics, patent cliff analysis, or drug-specific revenue breakdowns. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and the $950 fair value, presenting assumptions in isolation without demonstrating how they flow through to valuation outcome. Peer benchmarking is completely absent despite operating in a competitive duopoly with Novo Nordisk. ESG section is skeletal with repeated 'insufficient data' references. While evidence citations are consistent and redundancy is minimal, these structural gaps significantly undermine comprehensiveness.",
