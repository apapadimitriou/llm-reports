    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. Critical sections like Competitive Positioning and peer analysis are completely absent, despite being listed in contents. The Financials Snapshot is severely deficient, missing all essential life sciences sector KPIs (R&D intensity, clinical trial success rates, contract research margins, backlog conversion metrics). Most financial data shows 'Insufficient data' across multiple years, making historical analysis impossible. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value calculation - it mentions a DCF model but provides no actual cash flow projections or sensitivity analysis. ESG coverage is skeletal with admittedly 'insufficient data.' Multiple sections are extremely thin (Business Description is one paragraph, Economic Moat lacks depth). The report reads more like a quarterly earnings summary than comprehensive equity research, with substantial gaps that render it incomplete for investment decision-making.",
