    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic restatements and boilerplate insights typical of any fintech company. While it attempts some synthesis around FIS's Q2 2025 performance and AI integration, these insights lack depth and specificity. The valuation section presents a standard DCF model with conventional assumptions (5% revenue CAGR, 20% operating margins) without novel drivers or mechanisms unique to FIS. Key red flags include generic phrasing like 'high switching costs,' 'digital transformation trends,' and 'AI-driven efficiencies' that could apply to any financial technology firm. The report fails to provide company-specific angles beyond basic earnings recap, and most analysis paraphrases earnings call highlights without adding interpretive commentary. Decision relevance is low due to vague catalysts and lack of actionable insights distinct to FIS versus peers.",
