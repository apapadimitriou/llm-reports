    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some causal mechanisms and quantified assumptions but lacks rigorous benchmarking and scenario analysis. Causal explanations include \"4% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by robust digital engagement\" and \"Net interest income missed estimates amid ongoing pressure from the interest rate environment.\" The DCF model provides explicit assumptions like \"WACC is estimated at 8.5%\" and \"Terminal Growth Rate 2.5%\" with some quantification: \"EPS bridge starts from 2024 base of $3.20, adding $0.30 from revenue growth, subtracting $0.10 from higher provisions.\" However, key assumptions lack benchmarking - the terminal growth rate has no industry comparison, and sensitivity analysis is minimal. The report mentions \"valuation swings possible by \u00b120% under stress scenarios\" but provides no quantified scenario modeling. While actionable implications exist (\"recommend monitoring upcoming quarters\"), the analysis remains shallow with generic risk factors rather than comprehensive stress testing.",
