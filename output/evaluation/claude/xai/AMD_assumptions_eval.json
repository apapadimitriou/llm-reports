    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides key assumptions with partial justification and specificity. Revenue CAGR (15%), operating margin expansion (10% to 25%), and WACC (10%) are explicitly stated with some supporting rationale. However, justification is selective - the 25% data center growth assumption lacks peer benchmarks, and the aggressive margin expansion from 10% to 25% over 5 years is not adequately supported by historical performance or industry comparisons. Internal consistency has minor issues with some 'insufficient data' entries in financial tables. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivity analyses on any material drivers, only qualitative risk mentions. The EPS bridge provides some transparency, but key assumptions like the beta of 1.5 and specific growth rates by segment need stronger evidence-based support.",
