    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The report is dated May 21, 2025, yet cites future sources from July and August 2025, creating impossible chronological contradictions. The Q2 2025 earnings are described as reported on May 20, 2025, but the report references events that allegedly occurred months later. Additionally, there are multiple unresolved contradictions between narrative claims and data. The analyst states insufficient Q2 2025 data exists while simultaneously providing detailed analysis of those same results. Revenue projections show inconsistencies with segment growth claims, and the Bulls/Bears section lacks reconciliation with the optimistic base-case valuation despite highlighting significant cyclical risks. While individual sections contain reasonable analysis, the temporal impossibilities and internal contradictions make the report incoherent as a unified argument.",
    "evidence": [
        "Report dated May 21, 2025 cites sources from July 27 and August 6, 2025 - chronologically impossible",
        "Claims 'insufficient data on specific Q2 2025 metrics limits precision' while providing detailed Q2 2025 analysis throughout",
        "Bears emphasize cyclical semiconductor/communications risks but base case projects steady 5% growth without addressing this tension"
