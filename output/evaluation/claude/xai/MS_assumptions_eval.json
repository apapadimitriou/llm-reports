    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical dimensions. Assumptions are largely implicit and scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. Key drivers like the 5% revenue CAGR and 9% WACC lack proper justification - WACC calculation shows internal contradiction (beta 1.2 and risk-free 4% don't yield 9% without stating equity risk premium). The EPS bridge contains mathematical errors ($6.50 + $1.00 - $0.20 = $7.30, not the forecasted $7.3, though this appears coincidental). Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities despite acknowledging material risks like 20-30% deal activity reduction in recession. Margin expansion assumptions (+3% over 3 years) lack peer benchmarking or historical justification. The assumptions table in appendix is minimal and doesn't cover credit costs, tax rates, or share count changes. Overall, the model feels black-box with poor traceability between stated assumptions and financial projections.",
