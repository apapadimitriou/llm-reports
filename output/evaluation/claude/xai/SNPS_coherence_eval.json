    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inconsistencies and fundamental contradictions that undermine its coherence. The report is dated July 8, 2025, yet references Q2 fiscal 2025 results from May 28, 2025, and Q1 2025 results from February 26, 2025, treating these as historical events when they would be future dates. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet points with minimal transitions. The Bulls/Bears section presents competing views but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation narrative, particularly regarding competition risks versus the wide moat rating. The financials table contains 'insufficient data' entries for key metrics while simultaneously building detailed forecasts from these missing baseline figures. Citations reference relative dates like '4 days ago as of 2025-08-10' and '2 weeks ago as of 2025-08-10' that create temporal confusion. The narrative jumps abruptly between topics (earnings to AI to regulatory issues) without clear connective tissue, forcing readers to assemble the investment argument themselves.",
