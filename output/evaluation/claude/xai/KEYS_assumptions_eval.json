    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit assumptions with clear units and timeframes in the Fair Value section and Appendix table. However, justification is weak\u2014the 5% revenue CAGR lacks detailed support beyond generic segment trends, and the 8.5% WACC components (3% risk-free rate, 6% equity risk premium, beta 1.1) are stated without market evidence or sources. Operating margin expansion from 24% to 27% is asserted but not benchmarked against peers or history. Internal consistency has minor issues with insufficient Q2 2025 data noted multiple times, creating gaps in the model foundation. Most critically, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis\u2014no scenarios testing key drivers like revenue growth rates, margin assumptions, or WACC variations that would materially impact the $175 fair value estimate. This absence of stress-testing caps the grade at Fair despite reasonable specificity in assumption presentation.",
