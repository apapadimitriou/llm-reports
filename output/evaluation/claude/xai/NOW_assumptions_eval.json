    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely compromised by opaque modeling, insufficient justification, and complete absence of sensitivity analysis. While some key assumptions are stated in the appendix (20% revenue CAGR, 9% WACC, 30% terminal margin), they lack meaningful support\u2014revenue growth is justified only by 'Q2 growth trends' despite projecting identical 20% growth through 2029. The WACC calculation references beta 1.2 and 6% ERP without sources. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios for any material drivers, automatically capping the grade at Fair. The EPS bridge contains mathematical inconsistencies (claims 28% EPS growth from $12.50 to $16.00, but this equals 28% not the stated figure). Financial projections show dramatic margin expansion from 15% to 30% without detailed justification. Multiple assumptions rely on 'insufficient data' or 'analyst estimates' without backing. The combination of weak justification, missing sensitivities, and internal inconsistencies results in a Poor grade.",
