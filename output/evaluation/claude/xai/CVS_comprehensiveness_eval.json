    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with appropriate structure, but suffers from significant gaps in sector-specific KPIs and evidence quality. While the Financials Snapshot includes basic metrics (revenue, EPS, FCF), it completely omits critical healthcare sector KPIs like medical loss ratios, membership growth rates, prescription volumes, and segment-specific margins. The valuation section attempts to link drivers to outcomes but lacks explicit DCF calculations or sensitivity analysis. Evidence citations are inconsistent, with multiple instances of 'insufficient data' undermining credibility. Peer benchmarking is minimal, limited to brief ESG comparisons. The report demonstrates reasonable depth in business description and strategy sections, but the combination of missing sector KPIs, weak evidence foundation, and absence of scenario analysis caps the grade at Fair despite comprehensive section coverage.",
