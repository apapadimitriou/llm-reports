    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards with critical gaps throughout. The Financials Snapshot contains zero historical data (all marked 'insufficient data'), eliminating the ability to assess Microsoft's track record. Sector-specific KPIs for software companies (ARR, cloud metrics, subscription ratios) are completely absent. The Economic Moat section is skeletal with 'insufficient data' despite being core to Microsoft's investment thesis. Capital Allocation lacks any concrete analysis of balance sheet strength, dividend policy, or M&A strategy. ESG coverage is non-existent. Multiple sections rely on questionable sources including X posts for financial data. The valuation methodology lacks peer benchmarking and scenario analysis. While the report attempts to cover required sections, the execution is superficial with insufficient evidence and data gaps that render the analysis unreliable for investment decisions.",
