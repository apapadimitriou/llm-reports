    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely deficient across all five pillars. Explicitness is poor - key assumptions are scattered throughout without clear linkage to forecasts. Justification is nearly absent - critical parameters like WACC 7.0%, terminal growth 2.0%, and operating margins lack any supporting evidence or peer benchmarks. Specificity is weak with vague drivers and no clear causal relationships. Internal consistency is compromised by multiple contradictions: the report date conflicts with cited future sources, Q1 EPS of $2.46 annualizes to $9.84 yet 2025F EPS is $11.00, and revenue projections lack any historical baseline. Most critically, there are zero sensitivity analyses on any material drivers, automatically capping the grade at Fair, but the numerous contradictions and opaque assumptions drive it to Poor.",
