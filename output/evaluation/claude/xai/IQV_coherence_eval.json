    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that undermine its coherence. The most glaring problem is a fundamental contradiction in the EPS data: the Fair Value section claims 2024 adjusted EPS was $11.13 and projects 2025 EPS of $11.73, while the Financials Snapshot table shows 2024 actual EPS of only $7.49 and 2025 forecast of $7.87. This massive discrepancy renders the valuation unreliable. Additionally, there's temporal confusion with the report dated May 7, 2025, yet discussing Q2 2025 results from July as if they're already known. The Bears section mentions EPS declining 27% in Q2 2025, but this contradicts the base-case narrative of steady growth. Multiple sections read like disconnected bullet points with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections. The report also contains numerous data gaps marked as 'insufficient data' while still attempting definitive conclusions. These fundamental contradictions between assumptions, tables, and narrative, combined with temporal inaccuracies and poor flow, make the report extremely difficult to follow as a coherent argument.",
