    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inconsistencies and fundamental contradictions that make it incoherent. The report date is July 2, 2025, yet claims Q2 2025 results were reported on July 31, 2025 - a future date. The Analyst Note states Q2 results show 10% EPS growth but provides no actual quarterly figures, then immediately contradicts this by saying 'specific quarterly figures are not detailed in available sources.' The valuation section contains mathematical errors, claiming a fair value of $550 implies a forward P/E of 30x on projected $12.00 EPS (actually 46x, which is later correctly stated). The financials table shows 'insufficient data' for all historical years while making precise forecasts. Bulls/Bears points about $6B free cash flow and regulatory risks are never reconciled with the base case assumptions. Multiple sections read as disconnected lists with minimal transitions, and the sourcing includes questionable references like 'Posts found on X.' The report attempts a professional structure but fails basic coherence tests.",
