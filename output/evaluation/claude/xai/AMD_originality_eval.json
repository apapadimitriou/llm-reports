    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic insights that could apply to any semiconductor company, with extensive copying from sources. Key insights like 'AI demand driving data center growth' and 'competition from Nvidia' are sector-wide themes lacking company-specific angles. The valuation section presents standard DCF assumptions (15% revenue CAGR, margin expansion to 25%) without novel drivers or mechanisms. While there is one weak synthesis linking inventory write-downs to competitive positioning, most content restates public information from earnings reports and news articles. The analysis lacks actionable, AMD-specific insights that would differentiate it from generic semiconductor coverage. Red flags include boilerplate phrasing about 'scale and diversification' and recycled earnings highlights without deeper interpretation.",
