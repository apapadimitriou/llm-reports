    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with a proper contents page, but exhibits significant weaknesses in depth and rigor. While core sections like Analyst Note, Business Description, Valuation, and Financials Snapshot are present, the analysis lacks sector-specific KPIs critical for fintech evaluation (no mention of take rate, payment volume margins, or customer acquisition costs). The valuation section provides some linkage between drivers and fair value but relies heavily on extrapolated data with multiple 'insufficient data' disclaimers. Evidence integration is inconsistent, with several uncited claims and outdated information. The financials table contains forecasts but acknowledges extrapolation from limited sources. Redundancy is detected across sections, particularly regarding TPV growth figures and guidance repetition. Missing peer benchmarking and scenario analysis further limit comprehensiveness.",
