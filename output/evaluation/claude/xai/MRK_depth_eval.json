    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is overwhelmingly descriptive with virtually no analytical depth. It repeatedly states 'insufficient data available' for critical analytical components including valuation models, fair value estimates, and detailed forecasts. The few causal explanations are superficial, such as 'Keytruda generated $7.2 billion in sales, up 4% year-over-year' and 'Gardasil sales declined 41%... due to inventory and demand issues' without exploring underlying mechanisms. No explicit assumptions are provided for forecasting, no benchmarking against industry metrics, and zero quantified sensitivity analysis. The report mentions 'analysts project continued revenue expansion' but provides no supporting calculations or scenarios. Key valuation drivers like WACC, growth rates, or margin assumptions are completely absent. Risk factors are mentioned generically ('foreign exchange volatility', 'regulatory risks') but lack quantification or impact analysis. The report fails to meet even basic analytical standards.",
