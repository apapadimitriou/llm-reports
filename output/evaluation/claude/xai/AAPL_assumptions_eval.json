    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical dimensions. Key assumptions are largely opaque or buried without clear justification. The revenue CAGR of 6% is stated in the appendix but not explained or linked to underlying drivers. Operating margin expansion from 31% to 32.5% lacks supporting evidence beyond vague 'services mix' claims. The WACC of 8.5% appears arbitrary with minimal justification ('Beta 1.1, risk-free 4%' without sources). Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenarios testing these material assumptions. The EPS bridge attempts specificity but uses unsupported figures (+$2.00 revenue uplift, +$1.00 margin gains) without showing the underlying calculations. Revenue forecasts jump from unspecified Q2 annualized figures to $400B FY2025 without clear reconciliation. The terminal growth rate of 3% is stated without justification. While some assumptions are listed in the appendix, they lack the proximity, evidence, and stress-testing required for quality analysis.",
