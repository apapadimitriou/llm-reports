    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains mostly generic insights applicable to any large bank, with extensive boilerplate phrasing. While it attempts some synthesis around data analytics advantages and margin expansion projections, these lack company-specific mechanisms or novel drivers. The valuation section relies on standard DCF assumptions (5% revenue CAGR, 25% margin target) without unique catalysts. Key red flags include generic competitive advantage claims ('scale and data advantages'), copied content from sources, and broad sector-level observations. The few attempts at synthesis (linking interest rates to margin pressure, data analytics to charge-off performance) are superficial and lack quantified pathways or specific timing. Most insights could apply to any credit card issuer, failing the company-specificity test.",
