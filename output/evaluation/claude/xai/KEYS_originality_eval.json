    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some company-specific analysis but falls short of meaningful originality. While it attempts synthesis around AI/6G positioning and defense segment stability, most insights remain generic to the tech sector or restate public information. The valuation analysis lacks novel drivers beyond standard DCF assumptions with sector-typical growth rates. Key red flags include boilerplate phrasing about 'scale and diversification,' generic competitive positioning statements, and heavy reliance on paraphrased earnings call content. The defense/AI thesis, while company-relevant, lacks quantified mechanisms or unique catalysts that distinguish it from standard sector commentary. Only 1-2 weak syntheses are present, with most content being restated public information rather than original analysis.",
