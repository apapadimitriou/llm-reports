    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some causal reasoning and explicit assumptions but lacks depth in critical areas. Causal explanations include \"profit more than doubled, fueled by a surge in mergers\" and \"operating margins expanding to 28% by 2027, reflecting efficiency gains.\" Key assumptions are stated: \"WACC is 9%\" and \"Revenue CAGR of 5%\" with \"Terminal Growth 3.0%.\" However, these assumptions lack proper benchmarking or sensitivity analysis. The report mentions \"potential recession reducing deal activity by 20-30%\" but provides no quantified scenarios for the base case valuation. The EPS bridge attempts quantification: \"2024 base $6.50, plus $1.00 from revenue growth, minus $0.20 from higher expenses\" but oversimplifies complex drivers. While actionable implications exist (\"10-15% annual total returns if deal pipelines remain strong\"), they are conditional but not stress-tested. The report fails to provide sensitivity analysis on key assumptions like WACC, growth rates, or margin expansion, limiting analytical rigor.",
