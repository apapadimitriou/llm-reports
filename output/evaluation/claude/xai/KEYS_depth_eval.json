    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides some causal mechanisms and explicit assumptions but lacks depth in quantification and sensitivity analysis. Causal explanations include \"Revenue trends benefited from strength in aerospace, defense\" and \"Operating margins expand from 24% to 27%\" with scale efficiencies cited. Key assumptions are stated: \"5% revenue CAGR,\" \"WACC of 8.5%,\" and \"Terminal growth is 3%.\" However, these assumptions lack benchmarking or stress-testing. The report mentions \"valuation swing by 15-20%\" from operational risks but provides no scenario analysis for key drivers like AI adoption rates, defense spending levels, or semiconductor recovery timing. While implications exist (\"13% upside\" potential), they're not conditional on specific scenarios. The analysis remains largely descriptive with limited quantified sensitivity despite having the building blocks for deeper analysis.",
