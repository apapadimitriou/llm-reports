    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates virtually no original insights and consists almost entirely of restated information from company press releases. The analysis repeatedly acknowledges 'insufficient data' throughout key sections, resulting in empty valuation tables and generic commentary. The few analytical statements present are superficial restatements like 'innovation driving sustained growth' and 'strong momentum in multiple product areas' - boilerplate phrases that could apply to any medical device company. No synthesis of data points is attempted, no unique investment thesis is presented, and no quantified mechanisms or catalysts are provided. The report fails to go beyond paraphrasing source material and offers no decision-relevant insights that would help investors understand Medtronic's specific competitive position or future prospects.",
