    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely deficient across all quality pillars. Explicitness is compromised by pervasive 'insufficient data' entries throughout financial tables and key metrics. Justification is weak, with critical assumptions like 'Revenue CAGR 4.0%' supported only by vague references to 'industry trends' without specific sources or peer comparisons. Specificity is minimal - the WACC of 9% lacks proper derivation details, and the terminal growth rate of 2.5% is justified merely as 'Long-term GDP proxy.' Internal consistency suffers from a major contradiction: the text claims 2025 EPS of $7.50 but all EPS data in tables shows 'insufficient data.' No sensitivity analysis exists despite material drivers like interest rates and market volatility being acknowledged as key risks. The report essentially presents a black-box valuation model where core financial projections cannot be verified or stress-tested.",
