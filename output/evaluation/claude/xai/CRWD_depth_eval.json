    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some analytical depth with causal mechanisms like \"driven by strong adoption of its Falcon platform\" and \"ARR growth deceleration from 23% in FY2025 to 21.6% signals potential headwinds.\" It provides explicit assumptions including \"25% revenue CAGR through FY2029\" and \"10% WACC\" with basic rationale. However, critical weaknesses emerge: the 10% terminal growth rate lacks industry benchmarking, margin expansion projections of \"25% to 30% by FY2029\" are unsupported by detailed cost analysis, and the valuation model provides no sensitivity analysis. The report mentions risks like \"swinging valuation by 15-20%\" but fails to quantify scenarios or stress-test key assumptions. While it identifies counterpoints such as competitive pressures, these remain largely descriptive without exploring quantified impacts on forecasts.",
