    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and consistency problems that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The most glaring issue is a massive contradiction in the financial table showing 2024 revenue as $3,580 billion (impossible for any company) while other sections reference realistic figures. The report date of June 7, 2025 creates temporal impossibility when citing Q2 2025 results from July 2025 sources. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet dumps with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Description and ESG sections. Cross-references between sections are sparse, with Bulls/Bears points failing to meaningfully connect to the base-case valuation narrative. The sourcing is problematic, with placeholder URLs and insufficient data disclaimers throughout key metrics. Revenue projections jump erratically without explanation, and the EPS bridge calculation contains unexplained assumptions. The report requires readers to independently reconcile contradictions and assemble the analytical argument.",
