    "summary_reasoning": "This report fundamentally fails the quality of assumptions test. Assumptions are almost entirely absent or opaque\u2014the report repeatedly states 'insufficient data available' for critical valuation components including revenue CAGR, margins, WACC, fair value estimates, and forecasts. No explicit assumptions drive any financial model because no meaningful model exists. The few financial figures presented (Q1 2025 results) are historical data points, not forward-looking assumptions. There is zero justification for any forecasting parameters, no specificity around units/horizons/drivers for projections, and no sensitivity analysis whatsoever. The report acknowledges its own limitations by stating insufficient data for valuation models, economic moat assessment, and capital allocation ratings. While internally consistent in its admission of data gaps, this consistency around absence of content does not constitute quality assumptions. The report reads more like a news summary than an equity research analysis with actionable forecasting assumptions.",
