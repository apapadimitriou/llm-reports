    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides key assumptions but has significant weaknesses across all five pillars. Explicitness is partial - assumptions like 10% revenue CAGR and 8.5% WACC are stated but many drivers lack clear positioning near forecasts. Justification is weak, with most parameters unsupported (48% terminal margin, beta 1.1, 4% terminal growth lack evidence). Specificity is limited - while some units are provided, causal drivers and detailed horizons are often missing. Internal consistency has issues, including contradictory share count treatment (buybacks mentioned but dilution assumed in EPS bridge) and margin expansion claims conflicting with competitive pressure narratives. Most critically, sensitivity analysis is completely absent despite material drivers like AI adoption, competition, and macro risks being highlighted. The lack of quantified scenarios caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rule.",
