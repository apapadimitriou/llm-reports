    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally incomplete and superficial across all major sections. The Financials Snapshot is entirely empty with all metrics marked as 'insufficient data', violating the core requirement for sector-specific KPIs. Critical SaaS metrics like ARR, NRR details, and customer metrics are absent from the financial tables. The valuation section lacks any concrete analysis or fair value estimate, with no explicit linkage from operating drivers to valuation outcomes. Most sections are skeletal - Economic Moat, Capital Allocation, and ESG sections provide no substantive analysis. The report relies heavily on social media posts from X (Twitter) as primary sources, which undermines credibility. There is significant redundancy with NRR figures repeated across multiple sections without adding depth. The analysis feels more like a collection of fragmented data points than a comprehensive equity research report.",
