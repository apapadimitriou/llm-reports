    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some analytical depth with basic causal mechanisms and explicit assumptions, but falls short of rigorous analysis. Causal explanations are present but shallow: \"driven primarily by growth in the Evernorth Health Services segment\" and \"offsetting pressures from elevated medical costs\" provide directional reasoning without depth. The DCF model includes explicit assumptions like \"8% revenue CAGR\" and \"WACC of 7.0%\" with some benchmarking (\"P/E of 13x, aligned with historical averages\"), but lacks stress-testing or sensitivity analysis. The EPS bridge attempts quantification: \"add $1.50 from revenue growth, $0.70 from margin expansion\" but these figures appear arbitrary without supporting calculation details. Risk discussion mentions \"potential valuation swing of \u00b120%\" but provides no scenario modeling. While actionable implications exist (\"recommend monitoring upcoming regulatory developments\"), they remain generic rather than conditional on specific outcomes.",
