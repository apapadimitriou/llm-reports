    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely compromised by pervasive opacity and contradictions. Key drivers like the 20% revenue CAGR, 9.0% WACC, and terminal growth rate of 4.0% are stated but lack any meaningful justification beyond vague references to \"AI and cloud growth\" or \"mature tech industry average.\" The financial model shows impossible precision (EPS growing from $8.00 to $17.5 over 5 years) while simultaneously admitting \"insufficient data\" for basic historical metrics across multiple tables. Critical contradictions include claiming a $500 fair value while showing a prior estimate of $450 in the same report without reconciliation, and stating both Q4 2024 revenue of $1.93B and FY2024 revenue of $7.0B (implying an impossible quarterly run-rate). The WACC calculation mentions beta 1.2 and risk-free 4.0% but provides no cost of debt or capital structure details. No sensitivity analysis exists for any material driver despite claiming \"medium uncertainty.\" The assumptions feel manufactured rather than analytically derived.",
