    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and poorly justified. Key drivers like the 7% revenue CAGR and 20% terminal operating margin are stated without proper historical or peer support. The WACC of 9.5% is mentioned only in passing with minimal justification. Multiple internal contradictions exist: the report claims 5-year gross margins of 49% but forecasts operating margins reaching 20% without reconciliation, and EPS projections don't align with stated revenue/margin assumptions. The financial table mixes actual and extrapolated data without clear distinction. No quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers. While some assumptions are explicitly stated, they lack the evidence-based justification and specificity required for credible forecasting.",
