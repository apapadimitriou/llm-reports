    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. While it includes the expected section headers, nearly every section lacks substantive content due to systematic 'insufficient data' disclaimers. The Financials Snapshot is completely empty with all metrics showing 'N/A', missing all sector-specific KPIs essential for medical device analysis (R&D spend %, gross margins by segment, device approval pipeline metrics). The Fair Value section explicitly states it cannot provide valuation due to lack of data, violating the core requirement of linking drivers to valuation. Economic Moat analysis is abandoned entirely. The report reads more like a template with placeholder content than a comprehensive equity analysis, making it fundamentally incomplete and unsuitable for investment decision-making.",
