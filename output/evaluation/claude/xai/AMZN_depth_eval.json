    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides some causal reasoning but lacks rigorous quantification and scenario analysis. Causal explanations include \"driven by strength in advertising\" and \"reflecting improved efficiency\" but mechanisms are often shallow. Key assumptions are stated (\"10% revenue CAGR over five years\", \"WACC of 8.0%\", \"Terminal growth is 4%\") but lack benchmarking or sensitivity testing. The report mentions \"valuation swings of \u00b120% possible\" but provides no quantified scenarios. Data use is inconsistent with frequent \"insufficient data\" notations undermining credibility. Counterpoints exist in Bears Say section but aren't explored analytically. Implications are generic (\"Amazon's diversified revenue streams position it well\") rather than conditional and decision-relevant. The analysis falls short of rigorous institutional standards with unsupported projections and missing stress tests.",
