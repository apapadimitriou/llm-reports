    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from fundamental opacity in key assumptions and severe data limitations. While some assumptions are explicitly stated (4% revenue CAGR, 8.5% WACC, 35% operating margins by 2029), most lack meaningful justification due to 'insufficient data' for all historical periods 2022-2024. The revenue growth assumption relies solely on one quarter's performance (Q2 2025 7.3% growth) to project multi-year trends, which is inadequate. The WACC components are stated but not sourced or benchmarked. Operating margin expansion from 30% to 35% lacks historical context or peer comparison. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers. The report acknowledges 'high uncertainty' and potential 20-30% valuation swings but provides no stress testing. Internal consistency cannot be verified due to missing historical data, creating a black-box effect where forecasts appear disconnected from verifiable performance trends.",
