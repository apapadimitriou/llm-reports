    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its credibility. Most critically, it contains a glaring temporal contradiction: the report is dated 2025-06-29 but repeatedly cites future events as historical facts, including Q2 2025 earnings 'published approximately July 2025' and references Q1 2025 results as past performance. The narrative frequently jumps between topics without logical transitions, particularly in the Analyst Note which abruptly shifts from Q1 results to transformation thesis to forward projections. Multiple contradictions plague the financial data - the text claims 2025 EPS forecast of $7.50, then $7.30 in valuation, while tables show $7.3. The report states 'insufficient data for precise 2024 actuals' yet provides specific 2024 figures throughout. Sources are problematic, citing 'posts found on X' for regulatory information and a CNBC article supposedly from July 2025. The Bulls/Bears section lists generic points without reconciling rate sensitivity concerns with the base-case assumption of margin expansion. Several sections read like disconnected bullet points, lacking connective tissue that would create a coherent investment argument.",

        "Report dated 2025-06-29 cites 'CNBC \u2013 Morgan Stanley MS earnings Q2 2025, Published approximately July 2025' as historical reference (Sources section)",

        "Bears cite rate pressure on margins while base case assumes margin expansion from 25% to 28% without reconciliation (Bulls/Bears vs Fair Value sections)"
