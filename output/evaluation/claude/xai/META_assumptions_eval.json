    "summary_reasoning": "The report explicitly states several key assumptions in an appendix table (15% revenue CAGR, 41% operating margin, 9% WACC, 3% terminal growth) with basic rationale provided. However, justification is weak\u2014most assumptions rely on single-quarter trends or generic benchmarks without multi-year history or peer comparisons. Specificity is partial, with units and timeframes clear but limited detail on causal drivers. Internal consistency has issues: the report claims 2024 EPS is 'insufficient data' yet builds forecasts from an assumed $18 baseline, and references Q1 2025 results in a June 2025 report as if they're recent. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios despite identifying material risks like regulatory changes and competition, which caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rules.",
