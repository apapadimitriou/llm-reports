    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inaccuracies and multiple contradictions that undermine its credibility. The report date is June 9, 2025, yet it discusses Q2 2025 results as historical fact while citing sources from August 2025 (future dates). The analyst claims Q2 results 'exceeded expectations' but provides no baseline for comparison. Critical data inconsistencies pervade throughout: the report states iPhone revenue increased 1.9% but admits the actual amount is 'unspecified,' making percentage calculations impossible. Geographic revenue percentages are presented as current facts but sourced to 2017 data. The financial snapshot table contains 'insufficient data' for FY2024 actuals yet builds forecasts on these missing foundations. Bulls/Bears arguments reference the same data points (wearables decline, China weakness) without reconciliation against the positive base-case narrative. Sections read like disconnected bullet points with minimal transitions, particularly the strategy and risk sections. The fair value calculation methodology lacks transparency, jumping between different growth assumptions without clear linkage to the supporting analysis.",
