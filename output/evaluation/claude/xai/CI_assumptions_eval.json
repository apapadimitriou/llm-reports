    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical dimensions. Key assumptions are largely unstated or opaque - the revenue CAGR of 8% appears in narrative without detailed segment breakdown justification, operating margin expansion to 4.5% lacks supporting analysis, and the WACC of 7.0% is mentioned only in appendix without derivation. Multiple contradictions exist: Q2 2025 results are cited as occurring in July 2025 (impossible timing), EPS projections show 2025E of $29.0 conflicting with stated range of $28.50-$29.50, and margin expansion assumptions contradict acknowledged cost pressures. Most critically, there are zero quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers despite significant regulatory and cost risks. The assumptions that do appear lack specificity in units, time horizons, and causal drivers. While some historical context is provided, justification for forward-looking parameters is weak or absent entirely.",
