    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally incomplete and fails to meet basic equity research standards. The financials snapshot is entirely empty with 'Insufficient data' across all metrics and years, providing no historical context or forecasts. Critical healthcare diagnostics KPIs (test volumes, revenue per test, lab utilization rates) are completely absent. The valuation section explicitly states it 'cannot be constructed without speculation' and provides no fair value estimate, price target, or investment recommendation. Most sections are skeletal - Economic Moat, Capital Allocation, and ESG sections contain no substantive analysis. The report reads more like a preliminary data gathering exercise than a comprehensive equity research piece, with repeated admissions of data insufficiency throughout.",
