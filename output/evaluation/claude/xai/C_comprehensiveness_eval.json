    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with a comprehensive contents page and structured approach. However, critical banking sector KPIs are missing from the Financials Snapshot (NIM, provisions, loan growth, CET1 progression). The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and the $70 fair value outcome - assumptions are listed but the bridge from drivers to valuation is incomplete. Evidence citations are present but inconsistent quality, with some claims like 'implied quarterly figure' based on unclear calculations. Peer benchmarking is superficial with only brief JPMorgan mention. Some redundancy exists across sections regarding transformation themes. While all major sections are present, the depth is thin in key areas like competitive positioning and risk quantification.",
