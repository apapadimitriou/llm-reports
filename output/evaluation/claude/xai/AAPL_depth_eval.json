    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some analytical depth but falls short of rigorous standards. Causal explanations exist but are often shallow, such as \"Services revenue reached $26.6 billion, up 12% year over year\" and \"Operating margin expanded slightly to 31%\" without deeper mechanism analysis. The DCF model provides explicit assumptions including \"6% revenue CAGR from 2025-2029\" and \"WACC is set at 8.5%\" but these lack benchmarking or stress-testing. The report attempts counterpoint analysis through \"Bulls Say/Bears Say\" but provides no quantified sensitivity scenarios. While it offers some actionable implications like the \"$245 fair value estimate\" suggesting \"10% upside,\" the analysis lacks the depth of scenario modeling or ranges that would demonstrate comprehensive analytical rigor. The EPS bridge attempts causal linkage but uses unsupported round numbers like \"+$2.00\" from revenue uplift without detailed justification.",
