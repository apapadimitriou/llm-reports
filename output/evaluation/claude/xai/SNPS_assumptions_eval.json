    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit key assumptions in a dedicated table (revenue CAGR 10%, WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 4%, margin peak 32%) with clear locations. However, justification is weak\u2014revenue growth relies on generic \"AI and semiconductor growth\" without peer benchmarks or detailed historical analysis. Specificity is partial, with units and horizons stated but limited causal drivers explained. Internal consistency shows minor issues with missing FY2024 actuals marked as \"insufficient data\" while building forecasts from this base. Most critically, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenarios for any material drivers, capping the grade at Fair per the hard cap rule. The WACC assumption lacks proper justification (no risk-free rate source, equity risk premium not clearly derived), and margin expansion from 28% to 32% lacks peer comparison or operational detail.",
