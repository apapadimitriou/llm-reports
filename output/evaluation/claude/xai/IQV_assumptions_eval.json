    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on multiple critical fronts. Key assumptions are largely opaque or contradictory. The DCF model claims a $260 fair value but the math doesn't work: starting from 2024 adjusted EPS of $11.13, adding the stated bridge components ($0.50 - $0.20) yields $11.43, not $11.73, and this doesn't support the $260 target at 22.2x P/E. Operating margins show internal contradiction - Q1 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.1% is used to imply 23% operating margin for 2025, but EBITDA margin should exceed operating margin. The forecasted EPS progression (7.87, 8.26, 8.67) doesn't align with the claimed 2025 EPS of $11.73 from the bridge analysis. Critical assumptions like WACC components, terminal growth justification, and margin expansion drivers lack proper support. The 8% WACC uses beta 1.1 and 5% equity risk premium but doesn't show the full calculation or justify the risk-free rate assumption. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers despite the significant valuation impact these would have.",
