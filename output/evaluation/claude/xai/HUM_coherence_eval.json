    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its credibility. Most critically, it contains a glaring temporal contradiction: the report is dated June 17, 2025, yet repeatedly references Q2 2025 earnings results as 'post-report date developments' that were 'released in late July.' This creates an impossible timeline where future events are discussed as historical facts. The narrative flow is choppy with abrupt topic transitions, particularly in the Analyst Note which jumps between market expectations, post-earnings results, and valuation without smooth connective tissue. Multiple sections read like bullet-point lists with minimal transitions, especially the Bulls/Bears and Risk sections. The report contains numerous unsupported claims marked as 'model-derived' or 'insufficient data,' undermining analytical rigor. Financial projections show dramatic inconsistencies, such as EPS dropping from $22.5 to $18.5 then jumping to $23.0 without adequate explanation. The sources section reveals poor citation practices with several entries marked as 'insufficient data' yet still referenced throughout the analysis.",
