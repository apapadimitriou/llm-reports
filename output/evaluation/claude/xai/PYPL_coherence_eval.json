    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal inconsistencies and internal contradictions that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The most glaring issue is the impossible timeline: the report claims to analyze Q1 2025 earnings from April 29, 2025, then discusses Q2 2025 results as historical fact, while citing sources from August 2025 - all impossible given standard reporting cycles. The narrative contradicts itself repeatedly, stating Q2 FCF dropped 42% to $656 million while maintaining strong cash generation claims. Bulls/Bears sections are completely unreconciled with the base valuation narrative, presenting opposing views without resolution. Multiple sections read like bullet dumps with minimal transitions, particularly the strategy and risk sections. The sources are misaligned with claims, with social media posts inappropriately cited for financial data and approximate dates throughout. Financial projections lack proper sourcing, with disclaimers of 'insufficient data' undermining key assumptions. The report requires readers to piece together the argument themselves due to these fundamental structural and factual problems.",

        "Report dated 2025-04-29 claims to analyze Q1 2025 earnings, then discusses Q2 2025 as historical fact with sources from August 2025 - temporally impossible (Analyst Note)",
        "Bears cite 'quarterly FCF declines, such as the 42% drop to $656 million in Q2' while Bulls emphasize 'strong free cash flow guidance' with no reconciliation (Bulls/Bears section)",
        "Sources include social media posts and approximate dates like '2025-08-05 (approx.)' undermining credibility of financial claims throughout"
