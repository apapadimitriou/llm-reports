    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely compromised by fundamental data gaps and internal contradictions. While key assumptions are explicitly stated in the Appendix (4% revenue CAGR, 30.5% margins, 9% WACC, 3% terminal growth), they lack proper justification. The entire historical data foundation is missing ('insufficient data' across all actual financials 2022-2024), yet forecasts are claimed to be 'based on Q1/Q2 2025 trends.' Critical contradictions include: Q2 2025 profits of $3.72B implying ~$15B annual earnings versus forecasted 2025 EPS of $45 on 320M shares ($14.4B), and claiming 2026 EPS of $48 derives from 2024 EPS of $40 plus adjustments totaling $8 net. The 9% WACC assumption uses beta 1.2 and 4% risk-free rate without supporting evidence. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers despite significant market volatility risks acknowledged. The revenue growth assumption relies on fragmentary quarterly data extrapolated across five years without peer benchmarking or historical validation.",
