{
    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from pervasive opacity and multiple contradictions that undermine assumption quality. Key valuation drivers lack justification - the 10% revenue CAGR, 12% terminal operating margin, and 8% WACC are stated without supporting evidence from history, peers, or sources. Critical contradictions include claiming Q2 2025 guidance while reporting from June 2027, AWS growth rates that conflict between sections (17% vs 15%), and inconsistent revenue forecasts. The financial table shows 'insufficient data' for 2024 actuals yet projects precise future figures. Most assumptions appear in a brief appendix table rather than being explicit near the forecasts they drive. No sensitivity analysis exists for any material drivers. While some assumptions have units and timeframes, the lack of justification, internal contradictions, and missing sensitivities result in a black-box model that fails basic quality standards.",
