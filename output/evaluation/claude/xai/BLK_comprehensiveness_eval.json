    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates adequate structural coverage with all major sections present and a complete contents page. However, critical deficiencies emerge in sector-specific depth and analytical rigor. The Financials Snapshot completely omits essential asset management KPIs (AUM, management fees by asset class, fee rates), providing only generic financial metrics. Evidence integration is severely compromised with pervasive \"insufficient data\" disclaimers undermining credibility. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value derivation, with assumptions appearing disconnected from business fundamentals. Peer benchmarking is superficial, limited to brief mentions without systematic comparison. Significant redundancy exists across sections, particularly regarding AUM figures and Aladdin platform benefits. Multiple uncited claims and outdated source references further compromise analytical integrity.",
