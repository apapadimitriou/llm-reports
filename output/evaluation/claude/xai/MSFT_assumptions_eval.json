    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely deficient across all quality dimensions. Explicitness is minimal - key drivers like the 12% revenue CAGR and 8.5% WACC are stated but buried without clear connection to forecasts. Justification is virtually absent, with the WACC components (6% risk-free rate, 5% equity risk premium, 1.0 beta) completely unsupported by evidence or sources. Specificity is poor - vague references to 'trends from sources' without actual data points or methodology. Internal consistency has major contradictions: the report claims Q2 2025 results but cites a July 2025 Yahoo Finance article about those same results, creating an impossible timeline. The financial table shows all historical data as 'insufficient data' yet somehow derives forward projections. Most critically, there are zero sensitivity analyses or scenarios for any material driver despite the $500 fair value estimate. The appendix lists only 4 basic assumptions in a simple table with no ranges, stress tests, or alternative scenarios. This represents a black-box valuation approach that fails to meet professional standards for equity research.",
