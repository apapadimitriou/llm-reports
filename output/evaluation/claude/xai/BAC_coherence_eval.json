    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and consistency problems that undermine its coherence. The narrative contains multiple temporal contradictions, treating Q2 2025 results as historical fact when the report date is 2025-07-02, yet citing sources from July 16 and July 20, 2025 - future dates that cannot exist. The Bulls/Bears section presents unreconciled tensions with the base case, particularly regarding interest rate impacts where bulls claim rates support NII while bears highlight Q2 NII misses, with no resolution in the valuation narrative. Critical data inconsistencies plague the analysis, including 'insufficient data' disclaimers throughout while simultaneously providing specific figures, and a fair value derivation that references a '2024 base EPS of $3.20 (insufficient data for exact)' yet builds precise forecasts. The financial table acknowledges uncertainty about 2024 actuals while presenting them as fact. Sources are problematic, with future-dated citations and vague references to 'Posts on X' and approximated peer data. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet points with minimal transitions, forcing readers to construct the argument themselves.",

        "Bulls claim 'High interest rates support net interest income' while Bears note 'Misses on revenue and net interest income in Q2 2025 signal vulnerability to rate changes' with no reconciliation in Fair Value section",
        "EPS derivation states '2024 base of $3.20 (insufficient data for exact)' while financial table presents 2024 EPS as definitive $3.20 - Fair Value/Financials sections"
