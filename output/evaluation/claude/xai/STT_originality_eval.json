    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates virtually no originality and consists almost entirely of generic, boilerplate content applicable to any asset management company. The analysis lacks company-specific insights, with most statements being vague restatements like 'AuCA growth from market recoveries' and 'fee pressures in the industry.' The valuation section provides no novel drivers beyond standard DCF assumptions with generic 4% revenue growth. Critical red flags include pervasive use of 'insufficient data' throughout financials, generic competitive positioning statements, and complete absence of quantified company-specific mechanisms or catalysts. No synthesis of multiple data points is evident, and the few insights presented could apply to any custody bank. The report reads like a template filled with placeholder content rather than original analysis.",
