    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains several generic restatements and boilerplate phrasing typical of standard equity research. While it presents some company-specific details like the 98% renewal rate and AI integration metrics, most insights lack originality. The analysis largely restates earnings results and standard competitive positioning without novel synthesis. The valuation section relies on conventional DCF assumptions (20% revenue CAGR, margin expansion to 30%) without unique drivers or mechanisms. Key red flags include generic phrases like 'secular shifts toward cloud-based automation,' standard moat analysis, and boilerplate ESG content. The report shows minimal synthesis beyond connecting AI adoption to growth, but lacks the depth and originality needed for higher grades.",
