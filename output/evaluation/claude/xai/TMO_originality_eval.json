    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates extremely poor originality with pervasive copying and paraphrasing from sources. The analyst note directly lifts phrases like 'world leader in serving science' and 'unrivaled portfolio of brands and technologies' from cited sources without any original analysis. The $2 billion investment plan is merely restated across multiple sections without synthesis or unique interpretation. Most critically, the report repeatedly states 'insufficient data' throughout key sections (Fair Value, Capital Allocation, Financials, ESG), indicating a complete lack of analytical work. The few insights present are entirely generic and applicable to any large healthcare company. No synthesis connects the investment plan to specific financial implications, competitive positioning, or actionable investment thesis. The report reads like a compilation of press releases rather than equity research.",
