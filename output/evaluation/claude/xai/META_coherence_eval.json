    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report contains multiple severe contradictions and temporal inaccuracies that fundamentally undermine its coherence. Most critically, the report is dated June 16, 2025, yet repeatedly claims to analyze 'Q1 2025 results' as historical data, creating an impossible temporal framework. The narrative contradicts its own tables - claiming 'Q1 2025 operating margin of 41%' while the financials table shows 'Insufficient data' for 2024 actuals. The Bulls/Bears section lacks reconciliation with the base-case valuation, presenting competing narratives without resolution. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly the Risk & Uncertainty and Capital Allocation sections. Citations are frequently misaligned or missing, with several claims marked 'insufficient data for specific citation.' The EPS bridge references assumed data rather than actual figures, and geographical revenue breakdowns cite outdated sources. These fundamental flaws require readers to construct their own coherent argument from contradictory fragments.",
