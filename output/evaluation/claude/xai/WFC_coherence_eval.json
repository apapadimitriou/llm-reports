    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency problems that undermine its coherence. The Analyst Note contains a fundamental temporal contradiction, claiming to analyze Q2 2025 results while citing Q1 2025 data and using a future report date of 2025-06-29. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly Bulls/Bears and Risk sections. The narrative contains unresolved contradictions between claims of 'robust Q2 earnings growth' and acknowledgment that 'specific figures are not detailed in available sources.' The valuation section presents detailed financial projections while simultaneously stating 'insufficient data' for historical figures, creating an internally inconsistent foundation. Cross-references between sections are weak, with assumptions not properly reconciled with the base-case narrative. The ESG section admits insufficient data while attempting analysis. Sources are improperly aligned with temporal claims, and the overall argument structure forces readers to assemble connections themselves rather than following a coherent analytical thread.",
