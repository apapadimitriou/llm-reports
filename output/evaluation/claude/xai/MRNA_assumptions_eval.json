    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely compromised by multiple contradictions and lack of justification. Key issues include: (1) A clear contradiction where 2025 revenue guidance is stated as both '$1.5-2.2B' in the analyst note and '$2.0B' in the financials table; (2) Historical data admittedly extrapolated rather than sourced ('insufficient data for precise 2024 figures, extrapolated from patterns'); (3) Critical assumptions like WACC 10.5% and terminal growth 3.0% lack any supporting evidence or peer benchmarks; (4) No sensitivity analysis despite high uncertainty rating; (5) Operating margin assumptions (-200% to 15%) are extreme without justification. While some assumptions are explicitly stated in the appendix table, the combination of contradictions, weak evidence base, and absence of quantified scenarios renders the model unreliable.",
