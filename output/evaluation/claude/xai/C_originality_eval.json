    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic restatements and copied content from earnings calls and financial news sources. While it provides some company-specific details like Q2 2025 results and transformation progress, the insights lack originality and synthesis. The valuation section uses standard DCF methodology with basic assumptions (5% revenue CAGR, margin expansion to 30%) without novel drivers or mechanisms. Key insights are either paraphrased from sources (transformation benefits, ROTCE targets) or represent generic banking analysis applicable to any large bank. The report fails to provide unique perspectives that go beyond public information, with most content directly restating earnings call highlights and standard financial metrics. No meaningful synthesis of multiple data points into new conclusions is evident.",
