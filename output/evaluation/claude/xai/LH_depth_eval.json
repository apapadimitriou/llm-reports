    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally deficient in analytical depth, consisting primarily of descriptive statements with virtually no causal reasoning, explicit assumptions, or quantified analysis. The few attempts at causal explanation are superficial, such as \"growth driven by volume recovery\" and \"margin pressures, possibly from cost inflation\" without any supporting mechanisms or quantification. The report repeatedly states \"insufficient data\" for critical valuation components including fair value estimates, WACC, margins, and forecasts. No sensitivity analysis, scenarios, or benchmarked assumptions are provided. The valuation section admits \"a full valuation model cannot be constructed without speculation\" and offers no quantified profit drivers or decision-relevant implications. Even basic financial metrics are missing, making any investment analysis impossible.",
