    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some analytical effort but falls short of originality. While it provides company-specific metrics (3.43B DAUs, $600 FVE, 15% revenue CAGR projection), most insights are generic restatements of earnings data without deeper synthesis. The AI integration angle (Meta AI reaching 1B users) represents weak synthesis but lacks quantified impact mechanisms. The economic moat section restates standard network effects theory. The valuation relies on conventional DCF assumptions (15% CAGR, 40% margins) without novel drivers or unique catalysts. Red flags include boilerplate phrasing about 'data advantages' and 'competitive pressures,' plus generic bull/bear points that could apply to any social media company. The report copies extensively from earnings releases without adding interpretive value beyond basic financial projections.",
