    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all major sections with a complete contents page and proper structure. However, it suffers from significant weaknesses that cap the grade at Fair. The Financials Snapshot lacks critical semiconductor sector KPIs (gross margin, R&D as % of revenue, fab utilization, ASPs) and contains multiple 'insufficient data' entries, making financial analysis incomplete. The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly bridge operating drivers to the $185 fair value through clear calculations. Multiple claims lack proper citations (e.g., market share data, competitive positioning statements). There is noticeable redundancy between sections, particularly Q2 earnings results repeated across Analyst Note and Bulls/Bears. While peer context exists superficially, comprehensive benchmarking is absent, and scenario analysis is completely missing despite high uncertainty rating.",
