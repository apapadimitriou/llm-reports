    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from fundamental opacity and inconsistencies that render its assumptions unreliable. Key drivers like WACC (7.0%) and operating margins (25-27%) are stated without justification, with WACC explicitly noted as based on 'insufficient data for precise inputs.' The revenue CAGR assumption of 4.5% conflicts with the company's own 2-3% guidance. Multiple critical contradictions exist: EPS projections show 10.80 for 2025 in one section versus 10.86 in another, and the financials table projects impossible precision (revenue to $108.1B by 2029) despite acknowledging data gaps. Most assumptions lack specificity regarding units, timeframes, or causal drivers. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material assumption. The pervasive use of 'insufficient data' combined with precise forecasts creates an internally contradictory framework that fails basic consistency requirements.",
