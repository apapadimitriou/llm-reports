    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates limited originality, with most insights falling into generic restatements or copied content categories. While it attempts some synthesis around Biogen's transition strategy and cost optimization, these are largely standard biotech themes without company-specific mechanisms. The valuation section relies on conventional DCF assumptions (4% revenue CAGR, margin expansion to 35%) without novel drivers or unique insights into Biogen's specific competitive position. Key red flags include boilerplate phrasing about 'aging populations driving demand' and 'portfolio diversification,' generic peer comparisons, and standard financial projections. The EPS bridge provides some structure but lacks original analytical insight. Most content appears paraphrased from cited sources without value-added commentary. The report fails to present testable, decision-relevant theses with specific catalysts or timelines beyond generic pipeline monitoring.",
