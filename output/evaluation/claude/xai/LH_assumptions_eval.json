    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails catastrophically on all five pillars of assumption quality. Explicitness: The report openly states 'insufficient data' for virtually every key assumption including revenue CAGR, operating margins, WACC, and terminal growth. The Key Valuation Assumptions Table is completely empty with 'Insufficient data' for all entries. Justification: No evidence supports any forecasting assumptions - the report lacks multi-year historical data, peer benchmarks, or credible sources for modeling inputs. Specificity: Units, time horizons, and causal drivers are entirely absent. The report cannot even provide basic historical financials. Consistency: While there are no direct contradictions, this is only because no substantive assumptions are made. Sensitivity: Zero sensitivity analysis exists - the report explicitly states it 'cannot be constructed without speculation.' The assumptions are not just weak; they are fundamentally non-existent, making any valuation exercise impossible.",
