    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some company-specific analysis but is primarily composed of restated information and generic banking insights. While it attempts synthesis in areas like linking Q2 results to margin stabilization and connecting digital transformation to competitive positioning, these insights lack depth and quantified mechanisms. The valuation section follows standard DCF methodology without novel drivers beyond basic assumptions. Most insights are applicable to any regional bank rather than being PNC-specific. The report contains significant boilerplate language around 'diversified banking model' and 'regional dominance' without unique angles. Red flags include generic stress-test commentary, standard peer comparisons, and recycled analyst estimate references without original interpretation.",
