    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency problems that render it incoherent. Most critically, it contains fundamental temporal contradictions - the report date is 2025-06-27, yet it discusses Q1 2025 earnings as historical while citing a source from 2025-08-10 (future date) about Q2 2025 results. The narrative frequently states 'insufficient data' for basic metrics like market cap and current stock price, undermining credibility. Multiple sections read like bullet dumps with minimal transitions, particularly Bulls/Bears and Risk sections. The financial table contains numerous 'insufficient data' entries for 2024 actuals, yet the analysis builds projections from this missing foundation. Cross-references between sections are weak - the valuation assumes 10% revenue CAGR but Strategy section suggests 8-10% growth without clear reconciliation. Sources are problematic, mixing legitimate outlets with vague Twitter references and including impossible future dates. The ESG section references a 'Sustainalytics-equivalent score' without proper sourcing. While individual sections show some analytical depth, the overall report lacks connective tissue and contains too many internal contradictions to function as a coherent investment thesis.",
