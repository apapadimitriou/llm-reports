    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely compromised by fundamental contradictions and lack of proper justification. A critical contradiction exists between the claimed 8% revenue CAGR and the actual financial table showing 11% CAGR (2025-2029). Key assumptions like WACC (8.5%), terminal growth (3%), and operating margins (3.8% average) are stated but poorly justified with weak sourcing ('model-derived', 'insufficient data'). While some assumptions are explicit with specific units, the justification quality is consistently weak throughout. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers, violating the hard cap rule. The EPS bridge calculation appears internally inconsistent, and multiple assumptions rely on unavailable data sources. The combination of contradictions, weak justification, and complete absence of sensitivity analysis firmly places this in the Poor category.",
