    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally descriptive with fabricated data masquerading as analysis. Critical assumptions lack any causal mechanisms or benchmarking. The \"revenue CAGR of 5%\" and \"margin expansion to 25%\" appear without explanation of underlying drivers. The \"WACC estimated at 9%\" has no sensitivity analysis or justification beyond generic \"beta 1.2\" assumptions. Causal reasoning is superficial at best - \"Revenue growth was supported by higher net interest income\" provides no mechanism for how rate changes translate to earnings. The report contains numerous red flags including \"[assumed model]\" disclaimers and \"insufficient data\" admissions throughout. Most damaging is the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis despite claiming \"20% valuation swings from recession scenarios\" without any supporting calculations. The EPS bridge attempts quantification but relies on unsupported assumptions like \"$2.00 from revenue growth\" with no underlying methodology. This represents poor analytical depth with descriptive content packaged as rigorous analysis.",
