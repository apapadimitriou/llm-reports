    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and poorly supported. While some key assumptions are listed in the appendix (6% revenue CAGR, 8.5% WACC, 3% terminal growth), they lack justification with historical data, peer comparisons, or cited sources. The WACC of 8.5% is stated without derivation despite mentioning equity beta of 1.1. Revenue growth assumptions are not tied to specific AUM growth drivers or fee rate expectations. Operating margin expansion from 36.5% to 38.5% lacks supporting rationale. The report contains multiple internal contradictions: EPS projections vary between sections (EPS $42 in analyst note vs $41.50 in fair value section), and frequent '[insufficient data]' disclaimers undermine credibility. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers like AUM growth, fee rates, or market conditions. The assumptions feel disconnected from the forecasts they supposedly drive, making the valuation model essentially a black box.",
