    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report presents all major sections with reasonable structure but suffers from critical deficiencies that prevent a higher grade. While the content framework is comprehensive, the Financials Snapshot is severely compromised with 'insufficient data' for all historical years (2022-2024), making trend analysis impossible. Key biotechnology sector KPIs are missing, including R&D as % of revenue, pipeline value metrics, and drug approval timelines. The valuation section lacks explicit bridges from operating drivers to the $240 fair value estimate, with generic assumptions not clearly linked to Biogen-specific catalysts. Evidence quality is inconsistent, with one uncited ESG rating and several claims lacking proper attribution. The report demonstrates good sectoral knowledge but fails to deliver the depth and rigor expected for equity research, particularly given the data gaps and missing peer benchmarking.",
