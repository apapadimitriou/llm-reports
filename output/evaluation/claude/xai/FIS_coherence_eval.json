    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from fundamental temporal contradictions and structural incoherence that severely undermine its credibility. The most glaring issue is the report's claim to be analyzing 'Q2 2025 performance' and 'Q2 2025 earnings' when the report date is June 24, 2025, making these references to future events impossible. The narrative repeatedly treats Q2 2025 as historical fact while simultaneously being dated in Q2 2025. Beyond temporal issues, the report contains multiple unresolved contradictions: the narrative claims 5% Q2 2025 revenue growth as evidence of strength, yet the financial table shows only 4% annual growth from 2024 to 2025. The Bulls/Bears section lacks reconciliation with the base-case valuation narrative, presenting conflicting views without resolution. Sections read like disconnected bullet points with minimal transitions, particularly in Strategy & Outlook and Risk sections. The DCF model claims a 5% CAGR but the financial table shows inconsistent growth rates. Citations reference sources from 'days ago' relative to a future date, creating additional temporal impossibilities. The report requires readers to mentally reconcile numerous contradictions and timeline errors.",
