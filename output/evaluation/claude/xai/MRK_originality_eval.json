    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, consisting primarily of copied financial data and generic restatements. The analyst note directly paraphrases Q1 2025 earnings results without synthesis. Key insights like 'Keytruda driving majority of revenue but facing patent expiration risks' and 'diversified portfolio' are boilerplate pharmaceutical sector observations applicable to any large drug company. The Bulls/Bears section simply restates reported numbers without analytical interpretation. Most critically, the report acknowledges 'insufficient data' for valuation, moat analysis, and capital allocation - core analytical components. No synthesis connects multiple data points, no original thesis emerges, and no company-specific angles beyond basic product performance are presented. The few specific numbers cited (Keytruda $7.2B, Winrevair $280M) are direct copies from earnings releases without interpretive commentary or forward-looking implications.",
