    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides some key assumptions but with significant weaknesses across multiple pillars. Explicitness is partial - while some assumptions like 7% revenue CAGR and 7.5% WACC are stated, many are scattered or lack context. Justification is weak, with most assumptions unsupported by historical data or peer benchmarks. Specificity is limited - the report provides some units and timeframes but lacks detailed drivers. Internal consistency shows contradictions, particularly the EPS bridge math (base $27.75 + $1.50 - $0.75 = $28.50 but scaling to $37.0 by 2029 versus earlier claim of $40.0). Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for material drivers like medical loss ratios, regulatory changes, or WACC variations, which caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rule.",
