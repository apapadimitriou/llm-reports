    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable structure, but suffers from significant deficiencies that prevent a higher grade. While all major sections are present, the Financials Snapshot lacks critical sector-specific KPIs for banking (NIM, loan loss provisions, CET1 ratio details, book value metrics). The valuation section provides some linkage between drivers and fair value but lacks explicit bridge calculations and sensitivity analysis. Evidence citations are inconsistent, with some claims inadequately sourced (particularly the Sustainalytics ESG rating noted as 'inferred'). Peer benchmarking is minimal, limited to brief mentions without systematic comparison. The report demonstrates reasonable depth in business description and moat analysis, but the financial analysis feels generic rather than bank-specific, and redundancy appears across sections regarding dividend increases and earnings estimates.",
