    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some analytical depth with basic causal mechanisms and quantified assumptions, but falls short of comprehensive analysis. Causal explanations include \"driven primarily by robust demand for its GLP-1 agonist drugs\" and \"reflecting economies of scale and supply improvements.\" The DCF model provides explicit assumptions like \"15% revenue CAGR from 2025 to 2029\" and \"WACC is estimated at 7.0%.\" However, these assumptions lack proper benchmarking or industry context. The EPS bridge attempts quantification with \"add $2.50 from revenue growth, $1.00 from margin expansion\" but provides no sensitivity analysis. Risk factors are mentioned generically without quantified impact scenarios. The terminal growth rate of \"3%\" is stated as \"long-term industry average\" without supporting evidence. While the report identifies key risks like supply constraints and competition, it fails to model different scenarios or provide ranges around the $950 fair value estimate beyond a vague \"30% above or below\" statement.",
