    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic restatements and copied insights with limited synthesis. Key insights like 'record volumes demonstrate ability to benefit from volatility' and 'strong financial health with 23 years of dividends' are direct paraphrases from sources without added interpretation. The valuation section uses standard DCF methodology with assumptions (9% revenue CAGR, 60% margins, 20x PE) that lack novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. While there is one weak synthesis attempting to link Q1 performance to medium-term outlook (8-10% revenue CAGR projection), it lacks quantified causal mechanisms. The analysis is largely generic to exchange operators rather than CME-specific, with boilerplate phrases like 'network effects' and 'operating leverage' used without deeper exploration. Most content directly restates earnings results and analyst commentary without value-added perspective.",
