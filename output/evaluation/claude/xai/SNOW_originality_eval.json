    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates virtually no original insights or synthesis. The analysis consists almost entirely of copying data points from quarterly earnings reports and social media posts without any interpretive commentary. Key insights are generic restatements like 'growth driven by data management and AI trends' that could apply to any cloud data company. The report repeatedly states 'insufficient data' throughout critical sections including valuation, moat analysis, and financial projections. The valuation section uses completely hypothetical assumptions (30% CAGR, 20% operating margins, 10% WACC) with no company-specific rationale or novel drivers. No synthesis connects the declining net retention rates (142% to 127%) or moderating growth (36% to 29%) to any actionable thesis. The analysis lacks any peer comparisons, competitive positioning insights, or forward-looking catalysts beyond basic earnings dates.",
