Key assumptions like 13% revenue CAGR and 32% terminal operating margin are stated but weakly justified\u2014revenue growth relies primarily on Q2 guidance and vague industry trends rather than detailed historical analysis or peer benchmarks. The 9.5% WACC is mentioned with only beta (1.2) as justification, lacking proper cost of equity/debt breakdown. Specificity is partial\u2014units and timeframes are clear, but causal drivers are often vague. Internal consistency has minor issues with some metrics. Most critically, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis on any material drivers, capping the grade at Fair. While assumptions are more explicit than Poor-grade reports, the combination of weak justification and zero quantified sensitivities prevents a Good rating.",
