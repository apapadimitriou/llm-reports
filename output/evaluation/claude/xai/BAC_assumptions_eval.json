    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are fundamentally flawed with multiple contradictions and insufficient justification. Revenue CAGR is stated as both 3.5% (appendix) and implied as 3.6% from forecasted figures ($104B to $119.4B over 4 years). The report claims 2025 EPS of $3.50 but provides no clear derivation - the 'EPS bridge' mentions starting from '$3.20 (insufficient data for exact)' making calculations untraceable. WACC of 8.5% uses a risk-free rate of 4.0% without justification or current market context. Operating margin expansion from 28% to 32% lacks peer benchmarking or historical precedent. Most critically, no quantified sensitivity analysis exists for any material drivers despite significant rate and credit risk exposures. The assumptions appear in scattered locations without proximity to forecasts, making the model effectively a black box.",
