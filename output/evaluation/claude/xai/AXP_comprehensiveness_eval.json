    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "While the report includes most expected sections with a comprehensive structure, it suffers from critical deficiencies that prevent a higher grade. The Financials Snapshot completely omits essential banking/credit services KPIs like NIM, loan loss provisions, CET1 ratio, and charge-off rates, providing only generic metrics. The valuation section fails to explicitly link operating drivers to the $280 fair value calculation, jumping from assumptions to conclusions without clear mathematical bridges. Several material claims lack proper citations, including specific growth percentages and competitive comparisons. The report shows redundancy with credit quality metrics repeated across multiple sections without added depth. Peer benchmarking is superficial, limited to brief ESG score comparisons rather than comprehensive competitive analysis.",
