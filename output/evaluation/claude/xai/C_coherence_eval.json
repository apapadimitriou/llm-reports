    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe temporal and logical contradictions that undermine its credibility. Most critically, the report date is July 1, 2025, yet it discusses Q2 2025 earnings \"reported on July 15, 2025\" - a future date that creates impossible temporal logic. The narrative contains multiple unresolved contradictions: revenue is described as both growing 8% year-over-year and showing \"sequential stability\" compared to Q1, while the fair value section projects 5% CAGR but the strategy section forecasts 4-6% CAGR for the same period. The Bulls/Bears section lacks any reconciliation with the bullish base-case valuation narrative. Key assumptions appear disconnected from the analysis - margin expansion from 25% to 30% is projected but the financials table shows different starting points. Multiple sections read as bullet-point lists with minimal connective tissue, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections. Source citations are misaligned, with some references dated after the report date and others lacking proper URLs.",
