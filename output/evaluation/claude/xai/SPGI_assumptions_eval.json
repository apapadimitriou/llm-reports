    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from critical deficiencies across all assumption quality pillars. Key assumptions are scattered and poorly justified, with major contradictions undermining credibility. The report claims 8% revenue CAGR but provides no historical baseline, states fair value of $550 implying 46x P/E on $12 EPS (actually 45.8x), and shows inconsistent margin expansion timelines. Most critically, the financials table shows 'insufficient data' for all historical years, making growth projections baseless. The WACC calculation (8% with beta 1.0, risk-free 4%, cost of equity 9%) is mathematically inconsistent. Revenue forecasts jump from unspecified baseline to $14.8B in 2025 without justification. No sensitivity analysis is provided despite medium uncertainty rating. Sources are weak, relying on social media posts and generic investor relations pages rather than audited financials.",
