    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic restatements and boilerplate analysis with minimal original synthesis. While it attempts some company-specific details like the IHS Markit integration and specific financial projections, most insights are standard for any financial services company ('dominant position,' 'secular trends,' 'competitive advantages'). The valuation section lacks novel drivers, relying on standard DCF assumptions without unique mechanisms. Only 1-2 weak syntheses are present (linking ESG trends to subscription growth, margin expansion through cost synergies), but these lack depth and specificity. The analysis is largely indistinguishable from generic sector coverage, with extensive use of boilerplate phrasing. Red flags include insufficient actual data, generic competitive positioning statements, and standard financial metrics without unique interpretive angles.",
