    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits fundamental flaws across all assumption quality pillars. Explicitness is severely compromised with most key assumptions unstated or buried without context. Justification is weak, relying on single data points extrapolated without peer benchmarks or multi-year history. Specificity is poor - revenue CAGR of 9% lacks clear derivation, WACC of 8% appears without supporting calculation, and operating margins assume static 60% without basis. Internal consistency fails with multiple contradictions: Q1 revenue of $1.6B cannot annualize to $6.4B as claimed, and EPS calculations don't reconcile between sections. Most critically, there are zero sensitivity analyses on any material drivers, automatically capping the grade at Fair, but the numerous contradictions and opaque assumptions drive it to Poor. The valuation model appears black-box with assumptions scattered throughout rather than systematically presented.",
