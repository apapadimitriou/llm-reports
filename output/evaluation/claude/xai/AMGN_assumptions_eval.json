    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered without proper justification. While some key parameters are mentioned (6% revenue CAGR, 7.5% WACC, 3% terminal growth), they lack detailed support or derivation. The revenue CAGR is supposedly 'based on Q2 growth and guidance' but Q2 showed 9% growth, making 6% forward-looking CAGR unexplained. The WACC calculation claims beta 0.8 and 4% risk-free rate but doesn't show how this yields 7.5%. Operating margin assumptions (improving from unspecified current levels to 35% by 2029) are completely unjustified. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenarios provided for any material drivers. The financials table shows 'insufficient data' for all historical periods, making it impossible to validate assumptions against track record. The assumptions that do exist are not explicit about their derivation or proximal to the forecasts they drive.",
