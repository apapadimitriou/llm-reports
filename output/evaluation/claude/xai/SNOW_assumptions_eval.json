    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails on all five pillars of assumption quality. Explicitness: Key assumptions are buried in an appendix table with no connection to forecasts. Justification: Critical parameters like 20% operating margin and 10% WACC are completely unjustified\u2014described as 'assumed expansion' and 'standard tech discount' without any evidence. Specificity: The revenue CAGR claim of 30% contradicts the report's own growth data (29-36% range doesn't support a point estimate). Consistency: Multiple contradictions exist, including claiming insufficient data throughout while simultaneously providing specific forecasts. Sensitivity: Zero quantified scenarios or stress-testing despite material uncertainty. The assumptions appear disconnected from any actual financial model, making outputs feel entirely black-box.",
