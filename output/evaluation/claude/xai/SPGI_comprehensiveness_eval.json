    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. Critical gaps include missing actual historical financial data (all marked 'insufficient data'), absence of sector-specific KPIs for financial services (no metrics like ROE, book value multiples, or asset turnover), and lack of peer benchmarking or scenario analysis. The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly bridge operating drivers to the $550 fair value calculation. Sources are inconsistent and questionable, including 'Posts found on X' and future-dated articles (August 2025 article cited in July 2025 report). The ESG section lacks proper citations, and financial projections appear without supporting rationale. While the report covers expected sections structurally, the content is superficial with significant data gaps that render the analysis incomplete.",
