    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all major structural sections and demonstrates reasonable organization, but suffers from critical deficiencies that prevent a higher grade. Key issues include: (1) Missing essential sector-specific KPIs for e-commerce/tech (GMV, active customers, Prime penetration rates, AWS customer metrics), with only basic financial metrics provided; (2) Extensive use of 'insufficient data' placeholders throughout financial projections and analysis, undermining credibility; (3) Weak sourcing with multiple Twitter posts as primary sources and some outdated references (2018 Amazon IR link); (4) Valuation model lacks explicit mathematical bridges from operating drivers to fair value outcome; (5) Limited peer benchmarking context. While the report covers required content areas and shows sector awareness, the execution is hampered by data gaps, sourcing issues, and insufficient analytical depth for a comprehensive equity research piece.",
