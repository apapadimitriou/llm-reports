    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it attempts quantification, the analysis lacks clear causal mechanisms and relies heavily on unsupported assumptions. Key excerpts illustrate shallow reasoning: \"revenue CAGR of 7% through 2029\" appears without derivation, \"operating margins expanding to 20%\" lacks justification for the mechanism driving this improvement, and \"WACC of 9.5%\" is stated without benchmarking. The report mentions \"network effects\" but never explains how they translate to financial outcomes. EPS projections like \"rising to $7.50 by 2029 via revenue growth (+$0.50), margin expansion (+$1.00)\" are arbitrary allocations without underlying drivers. No sensitivity analysis exists - the single fair value of \"$85 per share\" has no range or stress testing. The report repeatedly notes \"insufficient data\" undermining confidence in conclusions.",
