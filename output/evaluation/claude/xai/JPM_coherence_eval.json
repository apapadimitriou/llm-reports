    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe coherence problems that fundamentally undermine its credibility. Multiple temporal contradictions plague the analysis, with sources dated July 15, 2025 for a report dated July 8, 2025, creating impossible chronology. The narrative contains numerous unresolved contradictions: the analyst claims 'profit slipped' while simultaneously describing 'strong results' and 'earnings surpassing estimates.' The Bulls/Bears section directly contradicts the base-case narrative\u2014bears cite 'flat deposits and loans' while the main thesis assumes 3-5% loan growth. Financial projections lack internal consistency, with operating margins forecasted to decline to 35% in 2025 then expand to 38% by 2029 without explanation. Throughout the report, critical claims are marked 'insufficient data' yet specific forecasts are provided anyway. The fair value methodology references a 2025 P/E of 12.4x but earlier states forward P/E of 12x for 2026 estimates. Sections read as disconnected modules with minimal cross-referencing, and the extensive use of bracketed 'insufficient data' qualifiers suggests the analysis is built on an inadequate foundation.",
