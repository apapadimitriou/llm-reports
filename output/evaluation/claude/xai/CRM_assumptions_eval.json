    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from critical deficiencies across all five pillars. While some key assumptions are stated in the appendix table, they lack meaningful justification - the 8% revenue CAGR is weakly tied to 'Q1 growth and guidance' without specific analysis, and the 9% WACC lacks proper derivation despite mentioning components. Multiple internal contradictions exist: Q1 operating margins are cited as both 19% and showing 'progress toward 20-22% levels,' creating confusion about the baseline. The forecasts table shows precise progression (20% to 25% margins) but this conflicts with narrative statements. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers, capping the grade at Fair, but the combination of weak justification, internal contradictions, and missing sensitivities results in Poor. The extensive use of 'insufficient data' throughout undermines confidence in the model's foundation.",
