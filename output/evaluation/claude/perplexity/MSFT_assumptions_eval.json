    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. While some figures are provided (Azure growth 28-30%, AI revenue $50B by 2027), these lack proper justification with historical context or peer benchmarks. Critical valuation drivers like WACC (8.5%) and terminal growth (3.0%) appear only in the appendix without supporting rationale. The financial projections table contains specific figures but the underlying assumptions driving these numbers are not explained or justified. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers. Multiple contradictions exist: AI revenue is cited as both $13B run rate and projected $50B by 2027 without reconciliation of the growth path. The report fails to meet basic standards for explicitness, justification, and stress-testing of key assumptions.",
