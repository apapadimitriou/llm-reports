    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates minimal originality and relies heavily on copying or lightly restating information from cited sources. Most insights are generic statements applicable to any major bank, such as 'transformation program delivering tangible results,' 'global footprint provides competitive advantages,' and standard regulatory/credit risk discussions. The valuation section presents a basic DCF with standard assumptions (3-5% revenue growth, 10-11% ROE targets) without novel drivers or mechanisms. While the report includes extensive data points, it lacks synthesis that connects multiple factors into unique conclusions. The analysis reads like a compilation of earnings highlights and generic banking commentary rather than providing decision-relevant insights specific to Citigroup's unique situation.",
