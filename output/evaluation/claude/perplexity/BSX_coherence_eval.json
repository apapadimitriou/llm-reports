    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its readability as a connected argument. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet-point lists without meaningful transitions, particularly the Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, and Risk sections. The narrative contains several unresolved contradictions: the Bulls/Bears section presents competing viewpoints without reconciling them with the base-case valuation assumptions, creating internal tension about growth sustainability versus competitive threats. Temporal accuracy issues appear throughout, with claims about 'recent' events and 'current' performance that lack proper dating context relative to the June 2025 report date. The financial projections table presents highly optimistic growth assumptions (revenue nearly doubling by 2029) that aren't adequately supported by the risk analysis or competitive discussion. Most critically, the report fails to create explicit cross-references between key sections - the valuation methodology doesn't clearly connect to the moat analysis or risk factors, and the capital allocation discussion operates independently of the strategic outlook. While individual sections contain detailed information, the overall document reads more like an information compilation than a coherent analytical argument.",
