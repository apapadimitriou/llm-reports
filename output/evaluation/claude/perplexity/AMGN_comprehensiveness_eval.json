    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. While it includes most expected section headers, the content is severely compromised by fundamental issues. The financials snapshot presents entirely fabricated multi-year forecasts (2025-2029) without any disclosed methodology or assumptions. Multiple material claims lack proper citations, with 18 sources listed but inconsistent in-text referencing. The valuation section fails to establish clear linkages between operating drivers and fair value conclusions. Sector-specific KPIs for biotechnology (pipeline risk-adjusted NPV, R&D efficiency metrics, patent cliff timelines) are largely absent. The report exhibits significant redundancy across sections and contains potential contradictions in financial projections. These deficiencies render the analysis unreliable for investment decision-making.",
