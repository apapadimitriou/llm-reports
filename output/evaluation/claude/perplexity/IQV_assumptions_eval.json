    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report completely lacks explicit financial assumptions driving its DCF valuation and target price. While it states a fair value of $197 per share and mentions key parameters like 5.5% revenue CAGR and 7.66% WACC, these figures appear without justification or supporting evidence. The financial projections table shows specific numbers through 2029 but provides no methodology, growth rate assumptions, or margin expansion drivers. Critical valuation inputs like terminal growth rate (3.0%) and target leverage (3.0x) are buried in an appendix without explanation. No sensitivity analysis exists for any material drivers despite significant uncertainties around biotech funding, regulatory changes, and competitive pressures. The assumptions are essentially opaque, making the valuation unauditable and the conclusions unsupported.",
