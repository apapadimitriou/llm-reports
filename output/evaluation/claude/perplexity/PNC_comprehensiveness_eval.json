    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits fundamental structural deficiencies that render it incomplete for equity research purposes. Multiple essential sections are entirely absent, including explicit Bulls/Bears analysis, competitive positioning, and proper peer benchmarking. The financials snapshot lacks critical banking sector KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), loan loss provisions, and detailed capital ratios. Most critically, the valuation section fails to establish clear linkages between operating drivers and fair value outcomes, presenting assumptions without connecting them to business fundamentals. Evidence sourcing is inconsistent with several uncited claims, and significant redundancy appears across sections with repeated mentions of branch investments and capital ratios without additional depth.",
