    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality and relies heavily on generic pharmaceutical industry analysis with extensive copying from source materials. While it contains detailed financial data and comprehensive sections, virtually all insights are either direct restatements of public information or generic observations applicable to any pharmaceutical company. The analysis lacks company-specific synthesis, with boilerplate phrases like 'wide economic moat,' 'sustainable competitive advantages,' and standard DCF assumptions throughout. The valuation section presents conventional metrics without novel drivers or mechanisms. Most critically, the report fails to provide any unique analytical perspective that goes beyond readily available public information, instead functioning primarily as a compilation of existing data points without meaningful interpretive commentary or original thesis development.",
