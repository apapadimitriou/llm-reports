    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates pervasive originality deficiencies with virtually all insights consisting of copied content from sources or generic biotechnology industry commentary. The analysis heavily paraphrases source material without adding interpretive value, such as directly restating Q2 2025 earnings figures, pipeline descriptions, and cost-cutting targets from company press releases. Generic statements like 'mRNA platform enables rapid development' and 'oncology pipeline offers significant upside potential' could apply to any biotechnology company. The valuation section presents standard DCF assumptions without novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. No synthesis connects multiple data points into unique conclusions, and no original thesis provides decision-relevant insights beyond publicly available information.",
