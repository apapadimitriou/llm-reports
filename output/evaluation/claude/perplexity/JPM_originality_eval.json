    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits pervasive originality deficiencies with numerous copied/paraphrased insights and extensive generic banking commentary. Key insights like 'fortress balance sheet,' 'diversified business model,' and 'scale advantages' represent standard boilerplate phrasing found across banking research. The valuation section relies on generic DCF assumptions (4-6% revenue growth, 18-20% ROE) without novel drivers or mechanisms. Most analysis consists of basic financial metric recitation rather than synthesis. While some company-specific data points exist (CET1 ratios, segment performance), these are presented as restatements rather than original analysis. The report lacks decision-relevant theses with specific catalysts or timelines, instead offering broad sector-applicable observations about credit normalization and NII pressure that could apply to any major bank.",
