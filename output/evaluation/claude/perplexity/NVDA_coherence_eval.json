    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that undermine its coherence. The narrative contains multiple unresolved contradictions, particularly between the analyst note claiming Q1 FY26 results 'exceeded expectations' while simultaneously highlighting a massive $4.5B inventory charge that significantly impacted profitability. The fair value estimate of $175 contradicts the current price of $182.70 being described as reasonable throughout the analysis. Temporal accuracy is compromised with future dates (report dated 2025-07-15 discussing Q2 FY26 guidance as current). The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation narrative. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists without proper transitions, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections. The financial projections table shows impossible revenue volatility (from $22.1B to $130.5B to $175B) without explanation. Citation formatting is inconsistent and many numerical references appear fabricated. The report lacks the connective tissue necessary for a coherent investment thesis.",
