    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards with numerous critical deficiencies. While it includes most expected sections, the execution is severely flawed. The Financials Snapshot lacks essential sector-specific KPIs for technology companies (R&D spending ratios, gross margins by segment, active device metrics, services attach rates). Multiple material claims are completely uncited, including specific figures like '$900 million quarterly tariff costs' and 'over 95% iPhone production in China.' The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to the $237.99 fair value through clear mathematical bridges. Extensive redundancy appears across sections, with tariff risks and China concerns repeated verbatim. The report reads more like a general business summary than rigorous equity research, lacking the analytical depth and evidentiary support required for institutional use. Sources are listed but rarely cited in-text, creating credibility gaps throughout.",
