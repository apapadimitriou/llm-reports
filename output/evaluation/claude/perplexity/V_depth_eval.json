    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is overwhelmingly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it presents extensive financial data and market information, it lacks meaningful causal explanations for performance drivers. The few attempts at reasoning are shallow: \"Payment volumes increased 8% year-over-year on a constant-dollar basis\" and \"cross-border volumes surged 13%\" provide no mechanistic explanation of why these occurred. The valuation section lists assumptions like \"WACC: 8.5%\" and \"Terminal growth rate: 3.0%\" without benchmarking or justification. Revenue projections show \"Revenue CAGR FY2025-2029: 10.0%\" but provide no quantified sensitivity analysis or stress testing of key assumptions. Risk factors are mentioned generically (\"Regulatory fee caps could reduce revenue by 1-2%\") but lack scenario analysis or probability weighting. The report reads more like a comprehensive company overview than rigorous equity analysis, failing to establish clear causal links between strategic initiatives and financial outcomes.",
