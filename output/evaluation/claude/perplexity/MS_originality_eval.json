    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, relying heavily on copied financial data and generic restatements of public information. The analysis lacks synthesis of multiple data points into unique conclusions and presents no original theses with specific mechanisms or catalysts. Key insights such as 'diversified business model provides defensive characteristics' and 'secular trends in wealth accumulation' are boilerplate phrases applicable to any large investment bank. The valuation section uses standard DCF methodology without novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. While the report contains extensive factual content, it fails to provide value-added perspectives that go beyond paraphrasing earnings releases and public filings. No decision-relevant insights with specific catalysts, timelines, or non-obvious conclusions are present.",
