    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report suffers from fundamental structural deficiencies that render it incomplete and superficial. Most critically, it lacks essential sector-specific KPIs for software/technology companies (ARR, NRR, customer retention, R&D as % of revenue trends, etc.) and provides fabricated financial projections without any methodological basis or sourcing. The Financials Snapshot presents multi-year forecasts as facts with no explanation of assumptions or models. Valuation methodology is skeletal, mentioning DCF and P/E multiples but failing to show actual calculations or explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value derivation. The report exhibits significant redundancy, repeating Ansys acquisition details and China restrictions across multiple sections without adding depth. Sources are improperly cited with no in-text references, and several key claims about financial metrics and strategic initiatives appear unsupported by the provided source material.",
