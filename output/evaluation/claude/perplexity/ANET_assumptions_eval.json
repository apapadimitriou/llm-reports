    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions driving the financial model are largely opaque and scattered throughout the report without clear connection to forecasts. The financial snapshot table presents specific projections (revenue growing from $7.0B to $13.8B, EPS from $2.23 to $5.85) but lacks explicit justification for these figures. Key drivers like WACC (11.5%), terminal growth (3.0%), and revenue CAGR (15%) appear only in the appendix without supporting rationale. Multiple internal contradictions exist: fair value of $82 conflicts with $94.97 stock price being described as 'stretched' yet only 1.16x fair value, and gross margins are stated as both 64% and expanding. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material assumptions despite high uncertainty ratings. The assumptions fail basic explicitness, justification, and stress-testing requirements.",
