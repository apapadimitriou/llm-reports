    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits fundamental structural deficiencies that render it incomplete as equity research. Most critically, it lacks essential sections including Bulls/Bears analysis, Competitive Positioning/Economic Moat discussion, and proper Capital Allocation assessment. The Financials Snapshot contains fabricated forward-looking projections (2025E-2029E) presented as factual data without methodology disclosure. Multiple material claims lack proper citations, including specific financial figures and strategic assertions. The valuation section fails to establish explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value methodology. Extensive redundancy appears across sections, with the same strategic themes repeated without additional depth. The report reads more like a comprehensive business overview than focused equity research, missing the analytical rigor and evidence-based framework expected for investment decision-making.",
