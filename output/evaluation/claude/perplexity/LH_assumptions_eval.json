    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails fundamentally on assumption quality. While it contains extensive narrative about Labcorp's business, the key financial assumptions driving valuations are almost entirely unstated or opaque. The DCF analysis mentions a WACC of 8.5% and terminal growth of 2.5-3.0% only in the appendix without any justification. Revenue growth assumptions of 5-7% CAGR lack supporting evidence from history or peer benchmarks. The financial projections table presents specific numbers through 2029 but provides no explanation of the underlying drivers or methodology. Critical valuation inputs like margin expansion assumptions, tax rates, and capex requirements are mentioned vaguely without specificity. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing anywhere in the document - only single-point estimates. The assumptions that do appear are scattered across sections without clear linkage to the forecasts they supposedly drive.",
