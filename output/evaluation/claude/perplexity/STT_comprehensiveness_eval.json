    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic equity research standards with numerous critical deficiencies. Most essential sections are completely absent, including Bulls/Bears analysis, competitive positioning, and peer benchmarking. The financials snapshot lacks fundamental banking sector KPIs (NIM, loan loss provisions, CET1 ratio, efficiency ratio) that are mandatory for custody bank analysis. Multiple material claims are completely uncited, including the $2.53 Q2 2025 EPS figure and $3.47B revenue that anchor the entire analysis. The valuation section provides no explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value methodology. Significant redundancy exists across sections, with AUC/A figures and Alpha platform benefits repeated without additional depth. The report reads more like a promotional summary than rigorous equity research.",
