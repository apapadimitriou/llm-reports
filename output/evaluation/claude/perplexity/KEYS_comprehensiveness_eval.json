    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards with multiple critical deficiencies. While it superficially covers expected sections, the analysis lacks depth and rigor throughout. The valuation section presents a $185 fair value estimate but provides no explicit methodology linking operating drivers to this outcome\u2014merely listing assumptions without showing calculations. The financials snapshot omits essential sector KPIs like R&D intensity ratios, gross margins by segment, and recurring revenue metrics that are standard for technology companies. Multiple material claims lack proper citations, including the $1.5B Spirent acquisition details and specific tariff impacts. The competitive positioning section is entirely absent, providing no peer benchmarking or market share analysis. Significant redundancy exists across sections, with Q2 2025 results repeated verbatim in multiple areas without adding analytical depth. The report reads more like a superficial summary than a comprehensive equity research analysis.",
