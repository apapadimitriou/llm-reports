    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without explicit connection to forecasts. While some financial projections appear in tables, the underlying drivers lack justification from history, peers, or cited sources. Key assumptions like the 7-9% revenue CAGR, 8.5% WACC, and margin expansion targets are stated but not supported with evidence or reasoning. The report contains no sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers. Most critically, there are significant internal contradictions between narrative claims and the financial snapshot table - particularly regarding historical margins and growth rates that don't align with stated recent performance. The assumptions fail on multiple dimensions: specificity is weak (vague ranges without clear drivers), justification is absent (no peer comparisons or historical analysis), and consistency is compromised by contradictory data points.",
