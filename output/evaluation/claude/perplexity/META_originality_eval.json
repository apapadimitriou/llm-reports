    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality and extensive copying/paraphrasing from source materials. The vast majority of insights are directly lifted from earnings reports and news articles without meaningful synthesis. Key passages like 'Q1 2025 revenue of $42.31 billion and earnings per share of $6.43' and specific financial metrics are copied verbatim from sources. The analysis consists primarily of generic restatements about advertising growth, AI investments, and regulatory risks that could apply to any major tech platform. While the report contains substantial company-specific data, it lacks original analytical frameworks, unique causal mechanisms, or decision-relevant theses. The valuation section presents standard DCF assumptions without novel drivers or company-specific insights. No meaningful synthesis connects multiple data points into new conclusions, and the competitive analysis merely restates publicly available information about TikTok competition without original perspective.",
