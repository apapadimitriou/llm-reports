    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates extensive copying and paraphrasing from source materials with minimal original analysis. The content heavily relies on restating public information about the Discover acquisition, regulatory changes, and financial metrics without providing unique insights or synthesis. Key sections like the analyst note simply restate basic facts about the $35.3 billion acquisition and Q2 2025 losses without adding interpretive value. The valuation section lacks novel drivers beyond standard DCF assumptions. While the report shows company-specific detail, it fails to present original theses or meaningful synthesis that would guide investment decisions. The analysis reads more like a compilation of press releases and earnings reports rather than value-added research.",
