    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains extensive factual information about Cigna's operations and recent transactions, it lacks meaningful causal explanations, explicit assumptions, and quantified sensitivity analysis. The few causal statements are superficial, such as \"driven by strong specialty drug volume growth\" without explaining underlying mechanisms. The valuation section mentions \"WACC: 7.5%\" and \"Terminal growth rate: 3%\" but provides no benchmarking, derivation, or sensitivity testing of these critical assumptions. The fair value estimate of $365 lacks supporting calculations or scenario analysis. Forecasts like \"revenue CAGR of 8-10%\" appear without justification or stress-testing. No counterpoint scenarios or quantified risks are explored beyond generic risk descriptions.",
