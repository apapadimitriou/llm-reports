    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency problems that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The document opens with a lengthy unformatted 'think' section that appears to be internal analyst notes rather than polished content, immediately disrupting the professional presentation. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet dumps with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Description and Strategy sections which jump between topics without logical flow. The report contains significant internal contradictions, most notably claiming Q1 2025 results while being dated May 2025, and citing financial figures that don't align between sections. The Bulls/Bears section presents arguments but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation narrative. The Fair Value section cuts off mid-sentence, leaving the analysis incomplete. Temporal claims about 'recent' events lack proper context, and the extensive use of bracketed citations creates choppy reading without clear source alignment.",
