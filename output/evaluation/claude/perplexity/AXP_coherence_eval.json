    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and consistency problems that fundamentally undermine its coherence. Most critically, the report is dated June 29, 2025, yet extensively cites future earnings results from July 18, 2025, creating impossible temporal contradictions throughout. The Analyst Note states \"American Express delivered robust second-quarter 2025 results\" with specific EPS and revenue figures, but Q2 2025 earnings wouldn't be available until mid-July. The Financials Snapshot table contains internally contradictive data - showing FY 2024A revenue of $74.2B while FY 2025E shows $71.3B, suggesting massive revenue decline that contradicts the bullish 9% growth narrative. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly Bulls Say/Bears Say and Risk sections. The fair value analysis lacks explicit connection to the assumptions table in the appendix, and key terminology shifts inconsistently between \"billed business\" and \"revenue\" without clear definitions. Sources are questionable, including several that appear fabricated or anachronistic.",
