    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency problems that make it difficult to follow as a coherent argument. Multiple sections read like disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Description, Risk & Uncertainty, and Capital Allocation sections. The report contains significant contradictions between narrative claims and data presented - for example, stating Q2 2025 EPS of $1.96 while showing projected 2025E EPS of $7.12 in the financials table, creating impossible math. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing views but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation narrative. Temporal claims are problematic, with sources dated from 2018-2025 mixed inconsistently and some 'recent' characterizations appearing misaligned with actual dates. The fair value estimate of $135.54 contradicts other intrinsic value ranges mentioned ($38.51-135.54) without explanation. Financial projections lack clear derivation from stated assumptions, and key terms like transformation program benefits are referenced repeatedly without consistent quantification across sections.",
