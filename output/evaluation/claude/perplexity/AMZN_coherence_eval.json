    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report contains multiple severe contradictions that undermine its coherence. Most critically, the cover block claims a report date of June 27, 2025, yet extensively cites future events including Q2 2025 earnings results and August 2025 market cap data, creating impossible temporal inconsistencies. The narrative contradicts itself regarding AWS growth rates, citing both 17% and 19% figures without reconciliation. Financial projections in the snapshot table appear disconnected from the narrative analysis, with no clear linkage between assumptions and outcomes. The Bulls/Bears section fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base-case valuation narrative, leaving fundamental tensions unresolved. Additionally, several sections read as disconnected bullet dumps without smooth transitions, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections. The report's extensive use of future-dated sources while claiming a mid-2025 perspective creates a fundamental logical impossibility that renders the entire analysis incoherent.",
