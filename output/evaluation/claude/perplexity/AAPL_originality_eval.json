    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates pervasive originality deficiencies that warrant a Poor grade. The analysis consists almost entirely of generic restatements and copied content from cited sources without meaningful synthesis or original insights. Key red flags include: (1) Standard financial projections presented without novel drivers or mechanisms, (2) Boilerplate phrasing throughout ('ecosystem advantages,' 'premium positioning,' 'switching costs'), (3) Direct paraphrasing of earnings results and public announcements, (4) Generic sector commentary applicable to any large technology company, and (5) Complete absence of unique analytical frameworks or non-obvious investment theses. The Bulls/Bears section exemplifies the lack of originality with recycled talking points. While the report includes extensive data, it fails to synthesize information into decision-relevant insights or provide company-specific angles beyond restating public information. No original thesis with quantified mechanisms, catalysts, or timelines appears anywhere in the analysis.",
