    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains virtually no original insights and consists almost entirely of generic restatements and copied content. The analysis lacks any synthesis that would provide unique value to investors. Key insights like 'leadership position in investment banking,' 'strong capital generation,' and 'durability of franchise' are boilerplate phrases applicable to any major bank. The valuation section presents standard DCF assumptions without novel drivers or mechanisms. Financial projections appear formulaic with no company-specific rationale. The report reads like a template filled with publicly available data rather than providing any interpretive commentary that goes beyond paraphrasing sources. No decision-relevant theses with specific catalysts or timelines are presented.",
