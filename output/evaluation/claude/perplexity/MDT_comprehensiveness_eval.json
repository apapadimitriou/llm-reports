    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits fundamental structural deficiencies that render it incomplete for equity research standards. While it contains extensive narrative content across multiple sections, it suffers from critical gaps in core analytical components. The financials snapshot lacks essential medical device sector KPIs such as R&D intensity ratios, gross margins by segment, days sales outstanding, and inventory turnover metrics that are standard for healthcare technology analysis. The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to establish explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value derivation through discounted cash flow mechanics or comparable company analysis. Most critically, the report completely omits peer benchmarking against competitors like Boston Scientific, Abbott, and Johnson & Johnson, eliminating crucial industry context. Additionally, scenario analysis and sensitivity testing are entirely absent, preventing assessment of valuation robustness under different operating assumptions. The excessive narrative length dilutes analytical focus while repetitive content appears across multiple sections without incremental insight.",
