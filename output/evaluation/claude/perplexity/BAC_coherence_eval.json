    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and consistency problems that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The temporal framework is completely broken - the report claims to be dated July 2, 2025 but discusses Q2 2025 results as historical events, while citing sources from 2015-2024 as if they're current. Multiple sections read like disconnected bullet lists with no transitional flow, particularly the Business Description and ESG sections. Critical contradictions plague the analysis: the cover block lists fair value at $48.50 while the text references $39.50 from Morningstar, creating confusion about the analyst's actual valuation. The Bulls/Bears section fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base case, leaving fundamental tensions unresolved. Financial projections appear fabricated rather than sourced, with no clear methodology linking assumptions to outcomes. Citations are misaligned throughout - sources about dividend declarations are used to support unrelated claims about digital users and technology spending. The report reads more like an AI-generated compilation of disparate facts rather than a coherent analytical argument.",

        "Cover block shows 'Report date: 2025-07-02' but discusses 'Q2 2025 earnings on July 16, 2025' as past events, creating impossible temporal logic",

        "Bulls Say section claims 'net interest income expansion potential' while Bears Say warns 'falling rates could compress net interest income' with no base-case resolution in valuation narrative"
