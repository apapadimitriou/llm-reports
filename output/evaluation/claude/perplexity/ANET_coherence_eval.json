    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report contains multiple critical flaws that severely undermine its coherence. Most fundamentally, the temporal framework is completely incoherent - it purports to be written on June 26, 2025, referencing Q1 2025 earnings as historical fact, while simultaneously treating this as future analysis. This creates impossible contradictions throughout. The narrative contains numerous unresolved contradictions: describing Q1 2025 revenue as both 'exceeding $2 billion for the first time' and later stating annual revenue of $7.003 billion, which would be mathematically impossible. The fair value estimate of $82 contradicts the last close price of $94.97 without adequate reconciliation in the valuation section. Cross-references between sections are minimal, with each section reading like an isolated analysis rather than building a cohesive argument. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints but fails to reconcile these with the base-case narrative or explain how the fair value estimate accounts for these divergent scenarios. Multiple sections, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections, read as bullet-point lists with minimal transitional language connecting ideas.",

        "Fair value of $82 vs. last close of $94.97 shows 16% undervaluation but valuation section provides no clear reconciliation with Bulls/Bears arguments"
