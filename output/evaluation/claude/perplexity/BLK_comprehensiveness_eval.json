    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. While it includes most section headers, the content lacks essential sector-specific KPIs for asset management firms (AUM growth rates, fee margins by asset class, net flows). The financials snapshot provides generic metrics but omits critical industry KPIs like organic growth rates, fee rates, and performance fees. The valuation section fails to explicitly link operating drivers to fair value assumptions, instead providing only high-level growth rates without detailed bridges. Multiple material claims lack proper citations, including specific financial projections and acquisition details. The report exhibits significant redundancy, repeating HPS acquisition details and AUM figures across multiple sections without adding analytical depth. Sources are listed but many claims in the text are not properly attributed to specific sources.",
