    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The document contains multiple unresolved contradictions between the narrative and tables, most notably claiming Q2 2025 results with a report date of July 2, 2025, which is temporally impossible. The fair value estimate of $585 contradicts the analyst consensus range of $537-627 mentioned earlier, and the financial projections table shows EPS declining from $12.8 in 2024 to $8.2 in 2023, which is chronologically backwards. Sections read like disconnected bullet points with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections. The Bulls/Bears analysis fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base-case valuation narrative. Citations are frequently misaligned with claims, such as referencing 2021 and 2018 sources for 2025 earnings data. The report requires readers to assemble the argument themselves due to poor connective tissue between sections and numerous internal inconsistencies.",
