    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its utility as an equity research document. The narrative contains multiple unresolved contradictions, most notably between the fair value estimate of $164 and the last close of $173.45, yet the analyst note fails to address this significant undervaluation implication. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints but provides no reconciliation with the base-case valuation narrative. Temporal accuracy is compromised throughout, with the report dated May 12, 2025 but referencing Q1 2025 earnings as recent events, creating confusion about the analytical timeframe. The document reads more like a comprehensive company overview than a focused equity research note, with excessive detail that obscures key investment insights. Critical sections like Risk & Uncertainty and ESG Risk function as bullet-point lists without meaningful transitions or analytical integration. The financial snapshot table lacks source attribution and appears disconnected from the narrative analysis, while key assumptions underlying the fair value estimate receive insufficient explanation or justification.",
