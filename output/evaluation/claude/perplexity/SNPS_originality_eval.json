    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, consisting almost entirely of restated financial data and generic industry observations. While it covers Q2 2025 results ($1.604B revenue, 10% growth) and mentions the Ansys acquisition, these are straightforward recitations of public information without meaningful synthesis. The analysis lacks any unique insights beyond standard DCF assumptions and boilerplate phrases like 'mission-critical position' and 'switching costs.' The valuation section presents generic assumptions (28x P/E multiple, 3% terminal growth) without novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. No original theses emerge connecting specific data points to actionable investment conclusions. The content reads like a compilation of earnings releases and industry reports rather than value-added analysis.",
