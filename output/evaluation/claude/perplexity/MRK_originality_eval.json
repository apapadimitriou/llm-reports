    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates pervasive originality failures with extensive copying and generic analysis. Multiple insights are directly paraphrased from sources without value-added interpretation, including boilerplate phrases like 'strategic imperative to diversify beyond Keytruda' and 'robust R&D investment.' The valuation section presents standard DCF assumptions with peak sales estimates that appear copied from external sources rather than original analysis. While the report contains company-specific details, these are largely restated facts rather than synthesized insights. The Bulls/Bears framework offers generic pharmaceutical sector observations applicable to any patent cliff situation. No meaningful synthesis connects multiple data points into novel conclusions, and the analysis lacks decision-relevant theses with specific mechanisms or catalysts beyond obvious patent expiration timing.",
