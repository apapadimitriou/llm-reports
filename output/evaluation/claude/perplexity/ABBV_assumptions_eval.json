    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet basic requirements for assumption quality across all five pillars. Key financial assumptions driving the $215 fair value estimate are largely unstated or opaque - the WACC of 7.5%, terminal growth rate of 3%, and revenue CAGR of 7-8% appear without justification or sourcing. The report provides no specificity on forecast methodology, valuation multiples, or time horizons for key projections. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers despite making bold claims about $31B combined sales targets and 45-47% operating margins. The assumptions extracted are scattered throughout without clear connection to the valuation model, and several key drivers like tax rates, share count changes, and detailed margin assumptions are completely missing. The report reads more like a qualitative overview than a rigorous financial analysis with auditable assumptions.",
