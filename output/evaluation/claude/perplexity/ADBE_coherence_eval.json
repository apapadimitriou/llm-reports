    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that make it extremely difficult to follow as a coherent argument. The document begins with a comprehensive executive summary that references specific financial metrics, but then immediately repeats much of the same information in the \"Analyst Note\" section without clear transitions or differentiation. Multiple sections read like disconnected bullet lists rather than flowing narrative analysis. The \"Bulls Say / Bears Say\" section presents contradictory viewpoints without any reconciliation to the base-case valuation narrative, creating unresolved tensions throughout the report. Most critically, the financial projections table shows operating margins jumping from 36.5% in FY 2024A to 45.5% in FY 2025E - a massive 900 basis point increase in a single year - yet the narrative discusses this as gradual margin expansion over multiple years. The temporal accuracy is also problematic, with the report dated 2025-06-13 but discussing Q2 FY25 results as if they are current, creating confusion about the actual reporting timeline. The excessive length and repetitive content suggest poor editorial discipline, while key terms like ARR and various cloud segments are used inconsistently across sections.",
