    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains numerous data points and financial projections, it lacks meaningful causal explanations for key relationships. The report states \"iPhone revenue decline signals fundamental challenges\" and \"Services division's 14% growth trajectory\" but provides no mechanistic reasoning for why these trends occur or how they interconnect. Assumptions like \"WACC: 8.5%\" and \"Terminal growth rate: 2.5%\" are listed without benchmarking or justification. The revenue projections show specific figures (\"Revenue ($B) 405.2, 423.4, 441.8\") but no sensitivity analysis or scenarios are provided. Risk factors are mentioned generically (\"tariff rates reaching 83%\") without quantified impact analysis beyond one isolated cost estimate. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints but lacks depth in exploring probability-weighted outcomes or conditional implications for different scenarios.",
