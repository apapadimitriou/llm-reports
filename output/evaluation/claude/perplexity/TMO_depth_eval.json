    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains extensive factual information about Thermo Fisher's business segments, financial metrics, and market position, it lacks meaningful causal explanations for performance drivers. The few attempts at reasoning are shallow, such as \"revenue growth acceleration driven by pharmaceutical and biotechnology market strength\" without explaining the underlying mechanisms. Key assumptions like \"WACC estimated at approximately 8.5%\" and \"terminal growth 3.0%\" are stated without benchmarking or justification. The valuation methodology mentions \"multiple expansion potential\" and \"19-20x forward earnings appears reasonable\" but provides no sensitivity analysis or scenario testing. Financial projections show specific numbers through 2029 but offer no explanation of how these forecasts were derived or what drives the assumed margin expansion. The report reads more like a comprehensive company overview than rigorous equity analysis, failing to provide the causal reasoning, explicit assumptions, and quantified sensitivities required for analytical depth.",
