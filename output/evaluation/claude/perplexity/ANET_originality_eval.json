    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, relying heavily on copied phrases and generic restatements from source materials. While it presents comprehensive coverage of Arista Networks, virtually all insights are either directly paraphrased from cited sources or represent standard analytical frameworks applicable to any networking company. The valuation section lacks novel drivers beyond basic DCF assumptions, and competitive analysis merely restates publicly available information about Nvidia competition without unique synthesis. Red flags include extensive boilerplate phrasing ('asset-light business model,' 'substantial switching costs'), generic bull/bear arguments, and financial projections without proprietary analytical angles. No meaningful synthesis connects multiple data points into original conclusions, and decision-relevant insights are absent throughout.",
