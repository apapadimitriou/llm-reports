    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, relying heavily on copied content from earnings materials and generic industry analysis. The vast majority of insights are direct restatements from Medtronic's Q4 FY25 earnings release and investor presentations, including specific revenue figures, growth rates, and strategic initiatives like the diabetes separation. Key sections like the analyst note and business strategy extensively paraphrase source materials without adding interpretive value. The valuation analysis presents standard DCF assumptions with no novel drivers or unique mechanisms. While the report shows comprehensive research, it fails to synthesize multiple data points into new conclusions or provide non-obvious investment theses. The content reads more like a summary of public filings than original equity research analysis.",
