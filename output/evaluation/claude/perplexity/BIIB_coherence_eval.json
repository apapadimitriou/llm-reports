    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and temporal incoherence that renders it fundamentally unreliable. Most critically, the report claims to be written in Q2 2025 while citing sources from 2022-2024 as current, creating impossible temporal contradictions throughout. The narrative presents Q1 and Q2 2025 earnings as historical facts while simultaneously positioning itself as a forward-looking analysis, demonstrating complete temporal confusion. Multiple contradictions plague the financial analysis: the Bulls/Bears section argues both that salanersen could generate $1.5-2 billion in peak sales while Bears worry about pipeline concentration risk, yet these opposing views are never reconciled with the base-case valuation assumptions. The financial snapshot table projects specific revenue and margin figures through 2029 without any supporting methodology or connection to the narrative discussion of declining MS revenues and emerging rare disease growth. Sections read as disconnected bullet dumps with minimal transitions - the Business Strategy section jumps abruptly from portfolio diversification to specific drug projections to cost management without logical flow. The ESG section appears completely disconnected from the main investment thesis, discussing environmental initiatives and governance without linking to valuation or risk assessment. Source citations are misaligned with claims, including references to articles from 2018-2022 presented as current market intelligence.",
