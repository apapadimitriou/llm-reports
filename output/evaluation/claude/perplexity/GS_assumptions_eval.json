    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without clear justification. While a financial forecast table is provided with specific numbers (revenue CAGR 5.0%, ROE 13.0%, WACC 8.5%), these critical assumptions lack any supporting evidence, historical context, or peer benchmarking. The revenue growth projection of 4-6% in text contradicts the 5.0% CAGR in the appendix. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers despite their significant impact on valuation. Key assumptions like the 11.5x P/E multiple and 2.5% terminal growth rate appear without justification. The report reads more like a business overview than a rigorous financial analysis with auditable assumptions.",
