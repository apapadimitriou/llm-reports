    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some causal statements like \"net income $8.1B ($1.96 per share) on revenues of $21.7B\" and \"credit costs increased 15% to $2.7 billion due to higher losses,\" these lack meaningful mechanism explanation. The report presents assumptions such as \"revenue compound annual growth rate of 3-5%\" and \"WACC assumption of approximately 9-10%\" but provides no benchmarking, sensitivity analysis, or stress testing. Key projections like \"ROE: 10-11% by 2026\" appear without supporting calculations or range scenarios. The fair value estimate of \"$135.54 per share\" lacks transparency in methodology. Most content consists of factual summaries rather than analytical reasoning about causation, risk quantification, or decision-relevant implications with proper uncertainty treatment.",
