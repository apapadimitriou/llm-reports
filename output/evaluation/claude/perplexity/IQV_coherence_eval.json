    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates clear overall structure and professional presentation but suffers from significant internal inconsistencies that undermine coherence. While sections generally flow logically and terminology is used consistently, critical contradictions exist between narrative claims and financial data. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation narrative, particularly regarding leverage concerns versus growth optimism. Most problematically, financial projections in the snapshot table show impossible precision (revenue growing from $16.2B to $19.9B through 2029) while narrative sections acknowledge substantial uncertainty. The fair value estimate of $197 per share lacks sufficient supporting detail in the valuation section to justify the precision claimed. Additionally, several sections read as disconnected summaries rather than integrated analysis, with abrupt transitions between topics like AI capabilities and debt metrics. Despite professional language and comprehensive coverage, these unresolved tensions require readers to independently reconcile conflicting information rather than following a coherent analytical thread.",
    "evidence": [
        "Bears cite '3.40x net debt-to-EBITDA constrains financial flexibility' while Bulls emphasize 'strong free cash flow generation supports aggressive share repurchases' - contradiction unreconciled in base-case narrative (Bulls Say/Bears Say vs Capital Allocation)",
        "Financial snapshot projects exact revenue figures to 2029 ($19.9B) while Risk section acknowledges 'macroeconomic uncertainty poses primary near-term risk' and client delay possibilities (Financials Snapshot vs Risk & Uncertainty)",
        "Fair value estimate claims $197 per share with 9.5% upside but valuation section provides insufficient DCF detail to support this precision given acknowledged uncertainties (Fair Value section)"
