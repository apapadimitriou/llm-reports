    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards with numerous critical sections completely missing or inadequately covered. The document lacks essential equity research components including a proper contents page, competitive positioning analysis, peer benchmarking, scenario analysis, and sector-specific KPIs. The financials snapshot provides only basic revenue and EPS data without healthcare diagnostics industry metrics like test volumes, revenue per test, or lab utilization rates. The valuation section completely fails to link operating drivers to valuation outcomes, presenting only assumptions without explicit bridges from business fundamentals to fair value. Sources are listed but rarely cited within the text, and the document contains significant redundancy across sections with the same strategic priorities repeated multiple times without additional depth.",
