    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report demonstrates severe structural and consistency problems that undermine its coherence. The most critical flaw is a fundamental temporal contradiction: the report is dated July 10, 2025, yet extensively cites Q2 2025 earnings results from July 23, 2025, creating an impossible timeline where future events are discussed as historical facts. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet-point lists with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Description and ESG sections. The Bulls/Bears section fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base-case valuation narrative, leaving contradictions unresolved. Financial projections show internal inconsistencies, with revenue growth assumptions varying across sections without explanation. The report suffers from poor flow within sections, jumping between topics without logical connectives. Citations frequently don't align with claims made, and terminology usage lacks consistency throughout. These fundamental flaws force readers to construct their own coherent argument from fragmented pieces.",
    "evidence": [
        "Report dated July 10, 2025 cites 'Q2 2025 EPS: $5.36 vs estimate of $5.23' from July 23, 2025 (Sources section)",
        "Business Description section lists four segments with percentages but no transitions explaining relationships or strategic rationale",
        "Bears cite 'flat full-year 2024 performance' while Bulls emphasize 'proven execution track record' without reconciling this contradiction in valuation narrative"
