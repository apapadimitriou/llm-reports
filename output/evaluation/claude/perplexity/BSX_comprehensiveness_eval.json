    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits fundamental structural deficiencies that render it incomplete and superficial. The Financials Snapshot completely lacks sector-specific KPIs essential for medical device analysis (R&D as % of revenue, gross margins, device approval pipeline metrics, clinical trial success rates). Multiple critical sections are entirely absent including dedicated Competitive Positioning analysis, Bulls/Bears section (only brief mentions embedded elsewhere), and any scenario/sensitivity analysis. The valuation section fails to establish explicit linkages between operating drivers and fair value assumptions, presenting conclusions without demonstrating the analytical bridge from business fundamentals to the $125 price target. Significant redundancy appears across sections with FARAPULSE performance statistics repeated verbatim multiple times without additional analytical depth. The report reads more like a company overview than rigorous equity research analysis.",
