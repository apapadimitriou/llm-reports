    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report suffers from critical structural deficiencies that render it fundamentally incomplete. Most notably, the entire document is missing - what appears to be provided is only the table of contents and section headers with no actual analytical content. Essential sections like Business Description, Valuation Analysis, Risk Assessment, and Financials Snapshot are completely absent or contain only placeholder text. The financial data table shows projections through 2029 but lacks any supporting analysis or methodology. Sector-specific KPIs for healthcare/pharmaceuticals (such as R&D as % of sales, pipeline value, patent expiration timelines, or drug approval success rates) are entirely missing. While 30 sources are listed, there is no evidence of actual citation integration within the missing content sections. The report structure suggests awareness of equity research requirements but fails to deliver substantive analysis across any major content area.",
