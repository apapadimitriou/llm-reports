    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. Critical sections are completely missing including competitive positioning analysis, peer benchmarking, and scenario analysis. The financials snapshot lacks essential banking-sector KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), loan loss provisions, book value per share, and tangible book value ratios. The valuation section provides a fair value estimate but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to valuation assumptions with clear mathematical bridges. Multiple claims lack proper citations, including the $2.5B cost savings target and specific transformation timeline details. The report exhibits significant redundancy, repeating transformation program details and regulatory challenges across multiple sections without adding new depth. While the structure appears comprehensive superficially, the content depth is insufficient for institutional equity research standards.",
