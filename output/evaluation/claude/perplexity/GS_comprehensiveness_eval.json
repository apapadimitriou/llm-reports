    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits fundamental structural deficiencies that render it inadequate as an equity research analysis. Most critically, the entire report appears to be fabricated, with fictional data points including impossible future dates (Q2 2025 results reported from a 2024 perspective), manufactured financial figures, and invented press releases with non-existent publication dates. Essential investment banking sector KPIs are completely absent - no Net Interest Margin, loan loss provisions, CET1 ratios, or other regulatory capital metrics that are fundamental to bank analysis. The valuation section provides generic assumptions without demonstrating how operating drivers connect to the $650 fair value estimate. Sources are fabricated with impossible future dates, violating basic research integrity standards. While the report superficially appears comprehensive with proper section headers, the content lacks analytical depth and sector-appropriate rigor expected for a major investment bank.",
