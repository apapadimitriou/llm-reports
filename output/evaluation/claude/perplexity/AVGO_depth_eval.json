    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some quantified projections like \"AI revenue could reach $60-90 billion by fiscal 2027\" and \"revenue reaching $110 billion by fiscal 2027,\" these lack explicit causal mechanisms or supporting assumptions. The report states \"AI-related revenue reached $4.4 billion, marking a 46% year-over-year increase\" but provides no explanation of underlying drivers. Valuation assumptions include \"WACC: 8.5%\" and \"Terminal Growth Rate: 3%\" but offer no benchmarking or sensitivity analysis. The fair value estimate of \"$415 per share\" appears with limited justification. Risk factors are listed generically without quantified impact scenarios. The analysis reads more like a comprehensive company overview than rigorous analytical reasoning with testable assumptions and scenario modeling.",
