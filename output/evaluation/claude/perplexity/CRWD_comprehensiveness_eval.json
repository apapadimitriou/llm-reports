    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits fundamental structural deficiencies that render it incomplete and unprofessional. Most critically, it lacks essential sections including Competitive Positioning, explicit Bulls/Bears analysis, and proper peer benchmarking. The Financials Snapshot contains fabricated forward-looking data presented as factual projections without proper sourcing or methodology disclosure. Multiple claims are unsupported by citations, including specific financial figures and growth projections. The valuation section fails to establish clear linkage between operating drivers and fair value methodology. Sector-specific KPIs for cybersecurity software (ARR growth rates, customer acquisition costs, net revenue retention) are inadequately covered. The report reads more like a general business overview than rigorous equity research, with significant gaps in analytical depth and evidence-based conclusions.",
