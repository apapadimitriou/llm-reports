    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates pervasive originality deficiencies that warrant a Poor rating. The analysis consists almost entirely of copied financial data, generic restatements, and boilerplate industry commentary without meaningful synthesis or original insights. Key sections like 'Bulls Say/Bears Say' present standard arguments applicable to any semiconductor company ('diversified portfolio,' 'competitive intensity,' 'regulatory headwinds'). The valuation methodology relies on generic DCF assumptions without novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. Financial projections appear fabricated without source attribution. Most critically, the report lacks any synthesis connecting multiple data points into new conclusions or original theses with specific catalysts and timelines. The content reads as a compilation of public information rather than value-added analysis.",
