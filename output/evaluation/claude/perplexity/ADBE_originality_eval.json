    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains extensive company-specific detail and strong financial analysis, but suffers from significant originality deficiencies that cap its grade at Fair. While the report demonstrates thorough research with 22 citations and comprehensive coverage of Adobe's AI strategy, most insights represent well-documented public information rather than novel analysis. The valuation section relies on standard DCF methodology without unique drivers or mechanisms. Key insights like 'AI integration strengthens competitive advantages' and 'subscription model provides predictable revenue' are generic statements applicable to most SaaS companies. The report does contain some synthesis around AI monetization timelines and competitive positioning, but these lack the specificity, quantified implications, and actionable catalysts required for higher grades. The analysis reads more like a comprehensive summary of known facts rather than providing decision-relevant insights that go beyond public sources.",
