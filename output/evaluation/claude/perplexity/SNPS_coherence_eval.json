    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The narrative contains multiple unresolved contradictions, particularly around financial projections and timeline accuracy. The report claims to be written as of 2025-Q2 but includes impossible future citations from 2025 events, creating temporal impossibilities throughout. Financial data lacks internal consistency between sections, with the Financials Snapshot showing dramatically different growth trajectories than discussed in the valuation section. The Bulls/Bears section fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base-case narrative, leaving readers to resolve contradictions independently. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet points rather than flowing arguments, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections. Cross-references between assumptions, tables, and narrative are frequently misaligned, with the fair value estimate methodology contradicting stated growth assumptions. The report requires readers to independently construct the investment thesis rather than presenting a coherent analytical framework.",

        "Bulls Say emphasizes 'manageable China headwinds' while Bears Say calls restrictions 'significant uncertainty' with no reconciliation in base case"
