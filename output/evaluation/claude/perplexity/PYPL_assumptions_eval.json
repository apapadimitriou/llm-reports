    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates critical failures across all assumption quality pillars. Key financial assumptions driving the DCF valuation (WACC 9.2%, terminal growth 3%, revenue CAGR 5.2%) are completely unstated in the main analysis with zero justification or sourcing. The brief appendix listing these figures provides no context, historical basis, or rationale. Multiple internal contradictions exist: revenue growth described as \"4-6% annual\" in fair value section but modeled at 5.2% CAGR; operating margins projected to reach 23% by 2029 despite recent performance of 17.8% with no explanation for this 520bp improvement. The financial projections table lacks any supporting assumptions about drivers, competitive dynamics, or sensitivity analysis. No quantified scenarios or stress testing of material variables appears anywhere. While the report covers business fundamentals comprehensively, the valuation methodology remains a complete black box with unjustified parameters.",
