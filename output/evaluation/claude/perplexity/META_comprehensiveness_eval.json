    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. While it contains all major section headers, the content lacks essential sector-specific KPIs for social media companies (MAU/DAU growth rates, ARPU by geography, engagement metrics). The financials snapshot omits critical metrics like revenue per user, advertising yield, and cost per impression. Multiple material claims are completely uncited (e.g., specific revenue figures, user counts, competitor data). The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly bridge operating drivers to the $770 fair value conclusion. Significant redundancy exists across sections, with Q1 2025 results repeated in Analyst Note, Strategy, and Bulls/Bears sections without new depth. The report reads more like a general business overview than rigorous equity research.",
