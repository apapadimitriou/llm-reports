    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits pervasive originality deficiencies with nearly all insights either copied from sources or presented as generic industry commentary. The analysis lacks meaningful synthesis, offering standard observations about revenue growth, competitive dynamics, and strategic initiatives without connecting disparate data points into novel conclusions. Key red flags include boilerplate phrasing ('dominant market position,' 'network effects,' 'competitive advantages'), generic DCF modeling with standard assumptions, and extensive paraphrasing of earnings results and management guidance. The valuation section presents conventional methodology without novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. While the report demonstrates comprehensive research with 22 sources, it fails to transform this information into original analytical insights that would inform investment decisions beyond what's readily available in public filings and news coverage.",
