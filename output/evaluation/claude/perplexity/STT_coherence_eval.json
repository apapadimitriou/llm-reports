    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "This report demonstrates reasonable structural organization and professional formatting but suffers from several critical coherence issues that prevent a higher grade. The narrative contains multiple unresolved contradictions, particularly regarding financial projections and temporal claims. The fair value estimate of $108.42 contradicts the current stock price of $111.75 being presented as attractive, while Bulls/Bears sections fail to reconcile with base-case assumptions about margin expansion and competitive positioning. Temporal inaccuracies are pervasive, with Q2 2025 results being presented as historical fact from a June 2025 perspective, and \"recent\" events spanning inconsistent timeframes. The report reads more like assembled sections than a cohesive argument, with limited cross-referencing between key components like valuation assumptions and risk factors. While individual sections contain detailed information, the lack of explicit connective tissue and internal consistency significantly undermines overall coherence.",
