    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from numerous critical coherence issues that severely undermine its readability as a unified analysis. The temporal framework is fundamentally broken, with the report dated July 8, 2025, yet referencing Q2 2025 earnings 'already released on July 15, 2025' - a logical impossibility that creates confusion throughout. Multiple contradictions plague the document: the executive summary claims Q2 results 'exceeded expectations' while the Analyst Note discusses Q1 results as if they were Q2, and financial data inconsistently switches between quarters without clear transitions. The Bulls/Bears section fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base-case valuation narrative, leaving tensions unresolved. Many sections read as disconnected bullet points rather than flowing analysis, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections. Key financial figures appear inconsistent across sections, and the heavy reliance on bracketed citations disrupts readability without adding substantive support to claims.",
