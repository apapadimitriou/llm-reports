    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that undermine its coherence. The narrative contains multiple direct contradictions, particularly regarding financial data and temporal claims. The report states Q2 2025 results multiple times but uses a May 2025 report date, creating impossible temporal relationships. Financial figures are inconsistent - the report claims both $1.31B and varying revenue figures without reconciliation. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing views but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation narrative. Many sections read as disconnected bullet points with minimal transitional language. The appendix includes numerous irrelevant sources that don't support the analysis. Most critically, the report presents itself as analyzing 'Q2 2025 results' from a May 2025 perspective, which is temporally impossible given standard quarterly reporting cycles. The valuation assumptions and financial projections lack clear connection to the narrative analysis, and technical terms are used inconsistently throughout.",
