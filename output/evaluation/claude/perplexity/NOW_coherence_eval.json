    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from fundamental structural and consistency issues that severely undermine its coherence. The report lacks proper section transitions, with abrupt jumps between topics that read more like disconnected bullet points than a unified analysis. Multiple sections contain unsupported claims with citations that don't align with the stated facts - for example, claiming Q2 2025 results were reported on July 23, 2025, while the system date shows August 10, 2025, creating temporal confusion. The financial projections table presents data without explanation of methodology or connection to the narrative assumptions. Most critically, the Bulls/Bears section presents contradictory viewpoints (22% growth being both strong and decelerating) without reconciliation in the base case valuation narrative. The report also contains inconsistent terminology usage and fails to establish clear logical connections between sections, requiring readers to assemble the argument themselves.",
    "evidence": [
        "Q2 2025 results 'reported on July 23, 2025' with current date of August 10, 2025 creates temporal inaccuracy in 'recent' claims throughout",
        "Bulls praise '22% growth' while Bears cite 'revenue growth deceleration from historical levels above 30% to current rates around 22%' without reconciliation in base case",
        "Financial projections table shows specific EPS growing from $6.80 to $18.50 over 5 years with no methodology or connection to narrative assumptions"
