    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. While some financial projections appear in the Financials Snapshot table, the underlying assumptions driving these numbers are not explicitly stated or justified. Key drivers like WACC (11.5%), terminal growth (3.0%), and pipeline success rates (25% oncology, 60% respiratory) are buried in the appendix without supporting rationale or sources. Revenue projections assume $2.0B for 2025 and growth to $8.3B by 2029, but the specific assumptions about market share, pricing, and competitive dynamics lack justification. The report contains internal contradictions, such as claiming 'very high uncertainty' while providing precise EPS forecasts through 2029. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers, and most assumptions lack historical benchmarking or peer comparisons. The DCF methodology is mentioned but key inputs remain unjustified black-box parameters.",
