    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains mostly restated information from sources with limited synthesis. While it provides comprehensive coverage of BAC's financials and operations, most insights are generic restatements of earnings data, dividend increases, and technology investments without unique analytical angles. The report lacks original theses connecting multiple data points into new conclusions. The valuation section presents standard DCF methodology without novel drivers or mechanisms. Only 1-2 weak syntheses appear (linking NII guidance to balance sheet positioning), but these lack specificity and actionable catalysts. Most content could apply to any large bank rather than providing BAC-specific insights.",
