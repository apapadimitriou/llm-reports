    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits pervasive copying and paraphrasing from sources with minimal original synthesis. The content primarily restates publicly available financial metrics (15% YoY revenue growth, $5.1B NGS ARR, CyberArk acquisition details) without adding interpretive value. Generic statements like 'competitive dynamics are intensifying' and 'secular shift toward cloud adoption' could apply to any cybersecurity company. The valuation section presents standard DCF methodology with no novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. Most critically, the report lacks any original thesis or synthesis that goes beyond summarizing earnings results and press releases. Decision relevance is extremely low as insights provide no actionable intelligence beyond what's already public.",
