    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits pervasive originality deficiencies that warrant a Poor rating. The analysis consists almost entirely of generic restatements and copied content from sources without meaningful synthesis. Key insights like 'AI revenue surging 220%' and 'VMware integration exceeding expectations' are lifted directly from cited materials with minimal interpretive value added. The valuation section presents a standard DCF framework with no novel drivers or mechanisms beyond restating management guidance. Generic phrases such as 'diversified technology platform,' 'sustainable competitive advantages,' and 'wide economic moat' appear throughout without company-specific analysis. The Bulls/Bears section offers boilerplate arguments applicable to any AI-exposed semiconductor company rather than AVGO-specific insights. Most critically, the report fails to provide any original synthesis linking multiple data points into new conclusions or present decision-relevant theses with specific catalysts and timelines. The analysis reads as a compilation of public information rather than value-added research.",
