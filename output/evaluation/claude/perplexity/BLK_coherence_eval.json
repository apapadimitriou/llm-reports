    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe coherence problems that fundamentally undermine its readability and credibility. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet-point lists without logical transitions, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections which jump between topics without connecting ideas. The report contains numerous internal contradictions, most notably claiming to analyze Q2 2025 results while being dated July 2025, creating impossible temporal relationships. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation narrative, leaving readers without clear guidance on how these tensions resolve. Financial projections appear disconnected from the narrative analysis, with growth assumptions that lack supporting rationale from the preceding sections. The extensive use of bracketed source citations disrupts reading flow and creates a fragmented presentation that resembles a research compilation rather than a coherent analytical argument.",
