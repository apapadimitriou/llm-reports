    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some causal statements like \"Revenue reached $2.5 billion, reflecting 4% growth\" and \"driven by continued demand for core banking modernization solutions,\" these lack specific mechanisms or quantified assumptions. The document states projections such as \"net EBITDA synergies exceeding $150 million by year three\" and \"over $500 million in additional adjusted free cash flow\" but provides no underlying assumptions, benchmarks, or sensitivity analysis. The financial forecast table shows specific numbers like \"WACC: 8.5%\" and \"Terminal Growth Rate: 3.0%\" but offers no justification, benchmarking, or stress testing of these critical assumptions. No scenario analysis exists - statements like \"if loan losses +50 bps\" or \"if Fed cuts rates\" are absent. The report reads more like a comprehensive company overview than rigorous equity analysis, lacking the causal reasoning depth required for investment decision-making.",
