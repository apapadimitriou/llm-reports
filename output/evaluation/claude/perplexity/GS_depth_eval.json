    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is overwhelmingly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it presents extensive financial data and projections, it fails to provide meaningful causal mechanisms or explicit assumptions. The few attempts at explanation are superficial, such as \"strong performance was driven by continued momentum\" without explaining why momentum exists or persists. Financial projections spanning 2025-2029 appear with no supporting assumptions, benchmarks, or sensitivity analysis. The fair value estimate of $650 lacks any methodological detail beyond vague mentions of \"sum-of-the-parts\" and generic assumptions like \"WACC: 8.5%\" with no justification. No scenario analysis, counterpoints, or quantified sensitivities are provided despite claiming \"medium\" uncertainty. The report reads more like a comprehensive summary document than analytical research.",
