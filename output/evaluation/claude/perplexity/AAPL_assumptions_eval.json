    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Apple research report fundamentally fails the quality of assumptions test across all five pillars. Assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout narrative text without explicit connection to forecasts. The financial projections table provides specific numbers (e.g., revenue CAGR 4.5%, Services CAGR 13.5%, operating margins 30.8%-32.0%) but these critical drivers lack justification with historical data, peer benchmarks, or credible sources. The WACC assumption of 8.5% and terminal growth rate of 2.5% appear without any supporting rationale. Most critically, there are zero sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers despite significant uncertainties around China risks, tariff impacts, and AI competition. The report reads more like a descriptive overview than a rigorous analytical framework with auditable assumptions driving the $237.99 fair value estimate.",
