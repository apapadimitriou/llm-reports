    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, relying heavily on copied content from earnings releases and generic industry commentary. The analysis consists primarily of paraphrased financial results from Q2 2025 earnings without meaningful synthesis or unique insights. Key red flags include extensive direct copying from press releases (e.g., '$1.31 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 beating estimates by $0.05'), generic DCF assumptions with no novel drivers, and boilerplate sector commentary about 'technology inflection points' and 'sustainable competitive advantages.' The valuation section presents standard assumptions without company-specific mechanisms or catalysts. While the report contains substantial company detail, it lacks decision-relevant synthesis that would differentiate it from readily available public information. No original theses or non-obvious investment angles are presented.",
