    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency problems that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The document reads like a collection of disconnected sections with minimal cross-referencing or narrative flow. Most critically, there are significant contradictions between the narrative and financial projections - the text claims Q2 2025 results while the financials table shows 2025 as estimated future years, creating temporal confusion. The Bulls/Bears section lacks reconciliation with the base case valuation narrative, with bears citing margin pressure while the financials project steady margin expansion from 35.2% to 37.5%. Multiple sections read as bullet-point lists without transitions, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections. The report jumps abruptly between topics without explaining connections, and key assumptions in the appendix don't align with the narrative discussion. The extensive use of bracketed citations creates a choppy reading experience, and many claims lack proper support or context within the flow of argument.",
