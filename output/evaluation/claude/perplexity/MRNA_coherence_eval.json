    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a clear overall structure and professional presentation but suffers from several significant coherence issues that prevent a higher rating. While sections generally flow logically and terminology is used consistently, there are notable contradictions between narrative claims and supporting data. The Bulls/Bears section presents arguments but fails to adequately reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base-case valuation narrative. Multiple sections, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections, read somewhat like organized lists with limited transitional language connecting key points. The temporal accuracy is generally maintained, though some forward-looking statements lack precise dating. The extensive source list suggests thorough research, but several claims about market positioning and competitive dynamics are not directly supported by the cited sources. The financial projections table contains internally consistent data, but the aggressive recovery timeline from 2025 losses to 2028 profitability is not sufficiently explained in the narrative sections.",
    "evidence": [
        "Bulls claim 'Strong market share gains in COVID-19 vaccines demonstrate commercial execution capabilities' while Bears argue 'heavy dependence on respiratory vaccines creates revenue volatility' - these opposing views are not reconciled with the $42 fair value estimate (Bulls Say/Bears Say sections)",
        "Business Strategy section lists three core priorities and competitive positioning points but provides minimal transitional language explaining how these elements connect to create coherent strategic framework",
        "Fair Value section projects breakeven in 2027 and 'meaningful profitability' in 2028-2029 but Risk section emphasizes 'very high uncertainty' and 'substantial risks' without adequately reconciling this tension"
