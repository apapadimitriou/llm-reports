    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report suffers from fundamental structural deficiencies that render it incomplete and superficial. The document abruptly cuts off mid-sentence in the valuation section, leaving critical analysis unfinished. While it contains some expected sections like Analyst Note and Business Description, the execution is severely flawed with missing core components including Bulls/Bears analysis (despite headers), competitive positioning details, comprehensive risk assessment, and capital allocation discussion. The financials snapshot is entirely absent, eliminating any sector-specific KPIs essential for pharmaceutical analysis such as R&D-to-sales ratios, pipeline metrics, or margin analyses. Citations are inconsistent with numbered references that lack corresponding source documentation. The valuation section fails to establish clear linkages between operating drivers and fair value calculations, presenting conclusions without supporting methodology. Multiple sections exist only as headers without substantive content, creating an impression of comprehensiveness while delivering superficial coverage.",
