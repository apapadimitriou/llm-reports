    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains numerous critical deficiencies in assumption quality. Key financial assumptions are largely unstated or opaque - the DCF model mentions a $210 fair value with 9.5% WACC and 3.0% terminal growth but provides no justification for these critical parameters. The financial projections table presents specific revenue and margin forecasts through 2029 without any supporting assumptions or methodology. Multiple internal contradictions exist: EPS jumps from $1.74 to $6.33 (264% increase) with no explanation, and revenue growth assumptions contradict stated deceleration trends. The CyberArk acquisition impact of '$800 million in annual revenue' lacks integration timeline or synergy assumptions. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material drivers including competitive risks, macro impacts, or acquisition integration. The report reads more like a comprehensive business overview than a rigorous financial analysis with auditable assumptions.",
