    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report suffers from severely opaque assumptions that are scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. Key financial projections in the Financials Snapshot table (revenue growing from $6.1B to $8.4B, EPS jumping from $9.85 to $24.50) lack any explicit justification or derivation. The Fair Value section mentions '$685 per share' using '28x forward P/E on $24.50 EPS' but provides no basis for these critical inputs. WACC/discount rate assumptions are buried in appendix without justification. Most concerning, there are clear contradictions: the report claims 'net cash position of $3.8 billion' while simultaneously stating 'debt-to-equity ratio of 101.4%' - these cannot both be true. China revenue projections show internal inconsistency (16% decline vs 15% decline in different sections). No quantified sensitivity analysis exists for any material drivers despite significant uncertainties around China restrictions and Ansys integration. The assumptions fail all five quality pillars.",
