    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some company-specific analysis but fails to provide sufficient original insights to warrant a higher grade. While it includes detailed financial data and attempts at synthesis (linking AI strategy to revenue growth, analyzing net revenue retention trends), most insights remain generic to the data platform sector or restate publicly available information. The valuation section relies on standard DCF methodology without novel drivers beyond basic AI adoption assumptions. Key syntheses like 'AI infrastructure positioning' and 'consumption-based model alignment' are industry-standard observations rather than unique analytical perspectives. The report shows competent research compilation but lacks the distinctive analytical frameworks, quantified causal mechanisms, or non-obvious investment theses required for higher grades. Red flags include boilerplate phrasing around 'picks and shovels' AI positioning and generic competitive analysis without specific differentiation mechanisms.",
