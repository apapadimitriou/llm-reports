    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality and relies heavily on copied/paraphrased content from source materials. The analysis consists primarily of generic restatements about Amazon's business segments, financial metrics, and standard DCF modeling without novel insights. Key insights like 'AWS maintains leadership position' and 'regulatory headwinds create risks' represent boilerplate observations applicable to any large tech company. The valuation section lacks innovative drivers beyond standard assumptions about margin expansion and revenue growth. While the report contains extensive data compilation, it fails to synthesize information into unique, decision-relevant conclusions that go beyond what's available in public filings and earnings releases. No original theses with specific mechanisms, catalysts, or non-obvious perspectives are presented.",
