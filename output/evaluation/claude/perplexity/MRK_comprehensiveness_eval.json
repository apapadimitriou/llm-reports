    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits fundamental structural deficiencies that render it incomplete for equity research standards. Critical sections are entirely absent, including competitive positioning analysis, peer benchmarking, and scenario/sensitivity analysis. The financials snapshot lacks essential pharmaceutical sector KPIs such as R&D as percentage of sales, pipeline value metrics, drug approval success rates, and geographic revenue breakdowns. Valuation methodology is superficial, mentioning DCF analysis but providing no actual model details, assumptions, or sensitivity ranges. Multiple material claims lack proper citations, including the $111 fair value estimate, WACC assumptions, and peak sales projections. The report suffers from significant redundancy, repeating Keytruda patent cliff concerns and acquisition details across multiple sections without adding analytical depth. Most critically, there is no meaningful peer comparison or industry context to benchmark Merck's performance, valuation multiples, or strategic positioning.",
