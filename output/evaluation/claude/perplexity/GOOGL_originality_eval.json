    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates pervasive issues with originality and analytical depth. The vast majority of insights are either directly copied from sources or represent generic restatements of publicly available information. Key examples include the verbatim lifting of Q1 2025 financial figures ($90.2B revenue, $2.81 EPS) without original interpretation, boilerplate descriptions of business segments that could apply to any tech company, and standard valuation methodology with no novel drivers. The analysis lacks company-specific synthesis beyond basic financial reporting. While the report mentions AI investment and regulatory risks, these are presented as generic industry themes rather than unique analytical perspectives. The valuation section employs conventional DCF assumptions without identifying proprietary insights or mechanisms. Red flags include extensive use of source-derived language, absence of non-obvious investment theses, and failure to provide decision-relevant analysis that goes beyond public information.",
