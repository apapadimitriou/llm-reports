    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from multiple severe coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its credibility. Most critically, it contains numerous temporal contradictions - claiming to be dated July 7, 2025 while citing future events like \"May 21, 2025\" earnings results and \"May 2025\" presentations as historical facts. The narrative treats fiscal 2025 as completed despite the report's supposed mid-2025 date. Financial projections show declining revenue from $33.5B in FY25E to $32.8B in FY26E without explanation, directly contradicting repeated claims of \"accelerating growth\" and \"mid-single-digit revenue growth.\" The Bulls/Bears section lacks reconciliation with base-case assumptions - bulls cite \"accelerating revenue growth\" while projections show deceleration. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists without transitions, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections. The fair value analysis claims \"mid-single-digit revenue CAGR\" but appendix shows 3.1% growth. These fundamental contradictions between narrative, tables, assumptions, and temporal claims create an incoherent document requiring readers to resolve multiple inconsistencies independently.",

        "Report dated 2025-07-07 cites 'May 21, 2025' earnings as historical while treating fiscal 2025 as completed - temporal impossibility",

        "Bulls cite 'accelerating revenue growth' while financial table shows 3.1% CAGR and declining near-term revenue - unreconciled contradiction"
