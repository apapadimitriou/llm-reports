    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains numerous critical deficiencies in assumption quality. Key financial assumptions are largely unstated or opaque, with revenue growth rates (3.1% CAGR), operating margin expansion (100-150 bps), WACC (8.5%), and terminal growth (2.5%) appearing only in a brief appendix without justification or supporting evidence. Multiple internal contradictions plague the analysis, including conflicting revenue figures ($33.5B vs $32.8B for FY25-26), inconsistent growth narratives (strong growth claims vs declining projected revenues), and contradictory margin stories (17.9% FY25 vs 18.5% FY26 without explaining the diabetes separation impact). The financial projections table shows declining revenues post-separation but lacks explicit assumptions about separation costs, stranded overhead, or business mix impacts. No sensitivity analysis exists for any material drivers despite significant uncertainties around tariff impacts ($200-350M), regulatory approvals, and business separation execution. The valuation methodology mentions DCF but provides no cash flow projections, discount rate justification, or scenario analysis.",
