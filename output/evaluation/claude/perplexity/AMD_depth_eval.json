    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it mentions some causal relationships like 'driven primarily by data center momentum', most statements lack mechanistic explanation. The report presents assumptions such as 'mid-teens compound annual growth' and 'operating margin expansion to mid-20% range' without benchmarking or justification. Quantification exists through financial projections, but these lack supporting logic or sensitivity analysis. The phrase 'AI accelerator revenue expected to scale from $5+ billion' exemplifies unsupported projections. Counterpoints are mentioned generically in 'Bears Say' section but not quantified or integrated into valuation. The fair value estimate of '$145 per share' appears with no derivation or stress testing. Risk factors are listed descriptively without impact quantification. Overall, the report reads more like a comprehensive summary than rigorous analysis with causal mechanisms.",
