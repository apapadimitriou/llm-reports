    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and consistency problems that prevent coherent reading. The Bulls/Bears section contradicts the base-case narrative repeatedly, with bulls claiming \"12% year-over-year growth\" while bears note \"flat year-over-year results\" for the same Q2 2025 period without reconciliation. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet dumps, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections, with abrupt topic jumps and minimal transitions. The report contains significant temporal inconsistencies, describing Q2 2025 events as historical facts when the report date is June 29, 2025, making references to \"Q2 2025 results\" temporally impossible. Key contradictions include claims of \"revenue compound annual growth rate of 4-6%\" in Fair Value while acknowledging \"muted revenue growth\" and \"flat year-over-year performance\" elsewhere. The Financials Snapshot table projects historical data for 2022-2024 as actuals when some periods haven't occurred yet relative to the report date. Critical terms like efficiency ratios and credit metrics are used inconsistently across sections without clear definitions.",
