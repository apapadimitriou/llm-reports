    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and unstated. While it presents detailed financial forecasts (revenue CAGR 8-10%, operating margins 6-7%, WACC 7.5%), these critical inputs lack justification or supporting evidence. The revenue growth assumption of 8-10% appears without historical context, peer comparisons, or sourcing. The WACC of 7.5% is stated in the appendix but not derived from market data or risk factors. Operating margin projections lack connection to business fundamentals or cost structure analysis. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers. The financial snapshot table presents multi-year forecasts without explaining the underlying assumptions that generate these specific numbers. The valuation methodology mentions forward P/E of 12.3x and EV/EBITDA of 9.2x but provides no justification for these multiples or comparison to peers.",
