    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, consisting primarily of copied earnings data and generic financial restatements. While it presents extensive financial details, virtually all insights are either directly copied from earnings releases (e.g., '$69.6 billion in fiscal Q2 2025 revenue, representing 12% year-over-year growth') or represent standard sector-wide observations about AI and cloud growth. The valuation section relies on generic DCF assumptions without novel drivers or mechanisms. No meaningful synthesis connects multiple data points into unique conclusions, and the analysis lacks company-specific angles beyond restating public filings. The report reads as a comprehensive summary of available information rather than providing value-added investment insights.",
