    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains substantial content but lacks meaningful original insights. While it demonstrates comprehensive research with 16 sources, the analysis primarily restates publicly available information without adding unique interpretive value. The report identifies FARAPULSE's $1B sales and management guidance raises, but offers no novel synthesis about competitive positioning, margin trajectory, or investment implications beyond what's already public. The valuation section presents standard DCF assumptions (8.5% WACC, 3% terminal growth) without any company-specific drivers or mechanisms. Most insights are generic to the medical device sector ('innovation leadership,' 'strategic acquisitions') rather than Boston Scientific-specific. The few attempts at synthesis lack quantified pathways or actionable catalysts. Red flags include boilerplate phrasing about 'category leadership strategy' and standard financial projections without novel analytical frameworks.",
