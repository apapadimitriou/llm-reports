    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The assumptions driving the financial model are largely opaque and scattered throughout the report without clear justification. Key parameters like the 9.5% WACC, 2.5% terminal growth rate, and 19x P/E multiple are stated in isolation without supporting evidence or calculation methodology. Revenue projections show internal contradictions - the text mentions 8-10% growth guidance while the table shows declining revenue from $74.2B (2024A) to $71.3B (2025E). Operating margin expansion assumptions lack specific drivers or historical context. The DCF model inputs appear in the appendix without connection to the forecasts they supposedly drive. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material assumptions despite significant uncertainty around credit normalization, interest rates, and competitive dynamics. The EPS growth projections of 13-15% annually are not reconciled with the specific figures in the financial table.",
