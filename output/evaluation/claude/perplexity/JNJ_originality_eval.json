    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates extensive copying and paraphrasing from source materials with minimal original analysis. The content heavily relies on restating earnings results, financial metrics, and generic pharmaceutical industry commentary without providing unique insights or synthesis. While the report includes detailed financial projections and valuation methodology, these represent standard DCF modeling without novel drivers or company-specific angles. The analysis lacks decision-relevant theses with specific catalysts, timelines, or mechanisms. Most insights are generic to the pharmaceutical sector rather than JNJ-specific. The report reads more like a comprehensive summary of public information than original equity research providing actionable investment perspectives.",
