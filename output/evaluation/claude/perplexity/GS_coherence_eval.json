    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency problems that undermine its coherence. The document contains multiple unresolved contradictions between narrative claims and financial data. Most critically, the fair value estimate of $650 contradicts the current price of $721.76 and the Price/FVE ratio of 1.11, which mathematically should yield $718.50. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints without any reconciliation in the base-case narrative. Several sections read as disconnected bullet points with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections. Temporal claims are problematic, with \"recent\" dividend increases citing 2023 sources in a 2025 report. The financial projections table shows implausible precision for future years without supporting methodology. Citations frequently don't align with claims, and the overall argument lacks connective tissue between valuation assumptions and business analysis.",
