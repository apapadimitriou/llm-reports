    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that undermine its coherence as an equity research document. The narrative contains multiple contradictions between sections, with Azure growth rates varying inconsistently (31% in one section, 33% in another, then 28-30% in projections). The Bulls/Bears section fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base-case valuation, presenting conflicting perspectives without resolution. Temporal accuracy problems pervade throughout, with references to 'fiscal Q3 2025' and 'May 2025' that appear inconsistent with the June 2025 report date. The financial projections table shows unrealistic growth trajectories that contradict more conservative assumptions mentioned in the text. Multiple sections read like disconnected bullet points rather than flowing narrative, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections. The report also contains internal contradictions between the $490 fair value estimate and analyst targets of $512.66 mentioned earlier, without explaining this discrepancy.",
