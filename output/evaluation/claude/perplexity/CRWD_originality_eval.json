    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits pervasive originality deficiencies that warrant a Poor grade. The analysis consists almost entirely of copied content from source materials with minimal synthesis or original insight. Key red flags include: (1) Direct copying of specific data points without interpretation (e.g., '8.5 million devices affected,' '$4.44 billion ARR with 22% growth'), (2) Generic sector-wide observations applicable to any cybersecurity company ('digital transformation tailwinds,' 'AI-powered security solutions'), (3) Standard DCF assumptions with no novel valuation drivers or company-specific mechanisms, (4) Boilerplate phrasing throughout ('land and expand model,' 'platform consolidation trends'), and (5) Bulls/Bears section that restates obvious positives and negatives without unique perspective. The report lacks any meaningful synthesis connecting multiple data points into new conclusions, offers no testable investment theses with specific catalysts or timelines, and provides no company-specific angles beyond what's available in public filings. While comprehensive in scope, the content represents sophisticated repackaging of source material rather than original equity research analysis.",
