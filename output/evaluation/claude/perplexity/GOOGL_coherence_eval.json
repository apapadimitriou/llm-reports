    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe coherence issues that fundamentally undermine its credibility. The most glaring problem is temporal inconsistency - the report claims to be dated June 7, 2025, yet references Q1 2025 earnings as historical data, which is chronologically impossible. The narrative contains multiple internal contradictions, including conflicting revenue figures ($90.2B vs $96.5B for different quarters) and inconsistent growth projections. The writing style shifts dramatically between sections, with some reading like polished analysis while others resemble bullet-point lists with minimal transitions. Key financial assumptions appear disconnected from the base-case narrative, particularly regarding AI investment returns and regulatory impact severity. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints but fails to reconcile them with the underlying valuation model or risk assessment. Citations are poorly aligned with claims, and several sections lack logical flow, requiring readers to construct their own argumentative connections. The report's fundamental structural issues and contradictory elements make it extremely difficult to follow as a coherent investment thesis.",
