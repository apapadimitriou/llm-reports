    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. While some financial projections appear in tables, key drivers lack explicit justification or sourcing. The revenue CAGR assumption of 5% to 2027 appears without supporting analysis of underlying business drivers. Operating margin expansion from 22.6% to 23.8% is stated but not justified with specific efficiency initiatives or benchmarks. The WACC assumption of 8.5% lacks any derivation or market-based support. Tax rate assumptions show no basis in historical performance or regulatory changes. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material assumptions. The terminal growth rate of 3.0% appears only in appendix without justification. Internal contradictions exist between narrative claims of 'mid-single digit growth' and the specific 5% CAGR assumption. The assumptions feel disconnected from the extensive narrative, creating a black-box modeling approach that fails basic transparency standards.",
