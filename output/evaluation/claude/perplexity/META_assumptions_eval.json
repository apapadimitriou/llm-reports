    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. While some growth rates are mentioned (14% advertising revenue CAGR, 39% target operating margin), these lack proper justification with historical data or peer comparisons. Critical valuation inputs like WACC (9.2%) and terminal growth (3.0%) appear only in the appendix without supporting rationale. The financial projections table shows specific EPS and revenue figures through 2029 but provides no explanation of underlying drivers or methodology. No sensitivity analysis is provided for any material assumptions despite significant uncertainties around AI capex ROI, Reality Labs losses, and regulatory impacts. The assumptions fail basic explicitness and justification standards, appearing more like unsupported point estimates than rigorous analytical inputs.",
