    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and coherence problems that render it difficult to follow as a unified argument. The document reads as a collection of disconnected sections with minimal cross-referencing and abrupt topic transitions. Most critically, there are significant contradictions between the narrative and embedded data tables. For example, the text claims Q2 FY2025 EPS of $2.76 while the Financials Snapshot table shows FY2025E EPS of $11.30 without explanation of this massive discrepancy. Revenue figures are similarly inconsistent, with Q2 revenue of $9.6 billion mentioned in text but annual projections starting at $38.9 billion for FY2025E. Temporal accuracy issues pervade the document, with claims about 'recent' events and partnerships that lack proper dating context. The Bulls/Bears section presents isolated viewpoints without reconciling them with the base-case valuation narrative or fair value estimate of $385. Individual sections often read like bullet-point lists rather than flowing analytical arguments, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections. Citations are frequently misaligned with claims, and key terms like revenue segments are used inconsistently throughout. The reader must independently piece together the investment thesis rather than following a coherent analytical framework.",
