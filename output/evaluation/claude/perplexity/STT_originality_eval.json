    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits pervasive issues with originality, containing numerous instances of copied or lightly paraphrased content from sources. The analysis relies heavily on restating earnings data and generic banking observations without meaningful synthesis. Key insights like 'fee revenue diversification reduces dependence' and 'scale economies provide competitive advantages' represent standard sector boilerplate applicable to any custody bank. The valuation section presents conventional DCF assumptions (4-6% revenue growth, margin expansion) without novel drivers or unique analytical frameworks. While the report demonstrates comprehensive source usage and professional formatting, it fundamentally lacks the interpretive commentary and company-specific synthesis required for original equity research. Most analytical statements can be traced directly to source material or represent generic banking sector observations rather than unique investment insights.",
