    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report suffers from fundamental flaws that render its assumptions largely opaque and unjustified. Key financial projections appear in the Financials Snapshot table without any explicit assumptions or justification in the text\u2014revenue growth from $51.6B to $135B by 2029, operating margin expansion to 66%, and EPS growth to $14.20 are presented as black-box outputs. The Fair Value section mentions a $415 target and 8.5% WACC but provides no source or calculation methodology. Multiple internal contradictions exist, including claims of 'conservative assumptions' while projecting 28% revenue CAGR and conflicting AI revenue figures ($60-90B guidance vs. specific projections). Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses for any material drivers despite the report's acknowledgment of significant risks. The assumptions that do appear are either unsupported (WACC, terminal multiples) or inconsistent with the aggressive growth projections presented.",
