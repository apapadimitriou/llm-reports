    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and coherence problems that render it difficult to follow as a unified analysis. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Description and Strategy sections which jump abruptly between topics without logical flow. The narrative contains significant contradictions: the Bulls section claims strong financial flexibility with 74.20% ROE while Bears correctly identify concerning debt-to-equity ratios of 2.18, yet these tensions are never reconciled in the base-case analysis. Temporal accuracy issues plague the document, with references to 'Q2 2025' results and 'August 2025' data that create impossible future-dating problems. The Fair Value section presents a $900 target with detailed assumptions but fails to connect these to the Bulls/Bears arguments or risk assessments. Key terminology is used inconsistently, and the massive citation list suggests over-reliance on external sources rather than coherent analytical synthesis. The reader must work extensively to piece together the actual investment argument.",

        "Bulls claim 'Financial metrics remain exceptional with return on equity of 74.20%' while Bears note 'elevated debt-to-equity ratio of 2.18 limits financial flexibility' with no reconciliation in base case (Bulls/Bears sections)",
