    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates pervasive assumption quality deficiencies across all evaluation criteria. Key financial projections spanning 2025-2029 are presented in a comprehensive table without any explicit justification, historical context, or supporting evidence. Critical valuation drivers including revenue CAGR of 4.8%, efficiency ratio target of 65%, and discount rate of 10.5% appear only in an appendix without explanation or derivation. The fair value estimate of $85.00 lacks transparent methodology beyond vague references to DCF analysis and P/TBV approaches. No sensitivity analysis or scenario testing is provided for any material assumptions despite significant uncertainties around commercial real estate exposure, interest rate impacts, and execution risks following regulatory relief. While the report mentions some financial figures from recent quarters, these are not systematically connected to forward-looking assumptions or used to justify projection parameters.",
