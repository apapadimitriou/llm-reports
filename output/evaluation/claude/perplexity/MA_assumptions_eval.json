    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains numerous critical flaws that render its assumptions largely unreliable. While some key assumptions are stated in the appendix (payment volume CAGR 9.5%, revenue CAGR 11.2%, terminal growth 3.0%, WACC 8.5%), they lack proper justification or supporting evidence. Multiple internal contradictions exist, including conflicting EPS figures ($15.89 vs $18.62 for 2025-2026), inconsistent revenue growth rates (13% vs 11.2% CAGR), and margin projections that don't align with stated EBITDA margins. The financial model lacks transparency with opaque derivations for most projections. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers, making the valuation essentially a black box. The assumptions that drive the $640 fair value target are not traceable through the analysis.",
