    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains primarily generic restatements and copied content from earnings releases with minimal original analysis. While it provides comprehensive coverage of Amgen's business, most insights are standard observations ('strong Q2 results,' 'patent cliff risks,' 'pipeline opportunities') that could apply to any large biotech company. The few synthesis attempts, such as linking debt levels to financial flexibility constraints, lack quantified mechanisms or specific catalysts. The valuation section presents a standard DCF framework without novel drivers or company-specific insights. Red flags include extensive boilerplate phrasing ('operational momentum,' 'strategic positioning'), generic competitive analysis, and financial projections that mirror consensus estimates without unique analytical angles.",
