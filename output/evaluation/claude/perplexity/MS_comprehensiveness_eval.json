    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards with multiple critical deficiencies. Most notably, it lacks essential sections including competitive positioning analysis, peer benchmarking, and scenario/sensitivity analysis. The financials snapshot omits crucial sector-specific KPIs for investment banks such as book value per share, tangible book value, return on equity, and net interest margin. The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to the fair value outcome of $145. Multiple factual claims lack proper citations, including specific revenue figures and performance metrics. The report also exhibits significant redundancy, repeating points about diversified business model and strong market positions across multiple sections without adding new depth.",
