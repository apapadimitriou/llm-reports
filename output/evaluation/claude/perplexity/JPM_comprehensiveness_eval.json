    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards with multiple critical deficiencies. The Financials Snapshot completely omits essential banking KPIs (NIM, CET1, ROE, ROA, loan loss provisions) that are fundamental to bank analysis, instead using generic metrics like ROIC that are inappropriate for banking. The valuation section lacks explicit linkage between operating drivers and fair value derivation, providing only vague assumptions without mathematical bridges. Peer benchmarking is entirely absent despite multiple references to 'peer group valuations' without substance. The report contains numerous uncited claims including specific financial figures, market share data, and strategic initiatives with no supporting sources. Additionally, significant redundancy exists across sections with repeated mentions of CET1 ratios, earnings beats, and competitive positioning without new analytical depth. The absence of scenario analysis further undermines comprehensiveness.",
