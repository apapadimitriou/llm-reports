    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates virtually no original insights and relies heavily on restating public information without meaningful synthesis. The analysis consists primarily of generic banking observations (\"diversified revenue streams,\" \"strong capital ratios,\" \"efficiency improvements\") that could apply to any regional bank. Key insights are either direct restatements of earnings data or boilerplate industry commentary. The valuation section presents standard DCF assumptions with no novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. While the report contains extensive factual content, it lacks the analytical synthesis, unique perspectives, or decision-relevant theses required for higher grades. No meaningful connections are drawn between data points to create new conclusions.",
