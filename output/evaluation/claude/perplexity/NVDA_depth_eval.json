    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains extensive detail about NVIDIA's business, it lacks causal mechanisms explaining performance drivers. The few causal statements like \"driven primarily by Data Center segment performance\" and \"creates significant switching costs\" are shallow and unsupported. Critical assumptions such as \"25-30% through FY27\" growth rates, \"Target margins of 72-75%\", and \"WACC: 12.5%\" appear without benchmarks, derivation, or sensitivity analysis. The report provides no quantified scenarios, stress tests, or ranges around key forecasts. Implications are generic rather than conditional and actionable. The extensive descriptive content masks the absence of rigorous analytical reasoning required for investment decision-making.",
