    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates pervasive copying and generic restatements with minimal original analysis. Multiple insights directly paraphrase source materials without adding interpretive value, such as restating China tariff impacts ($400M revenue, $375M operating income) and basic financial metrics. The analysis relies heavily on boilerplate language like 'wide economic moat,' 'secular growth drivers,' and standard competitive advantage descriptions. While the report attempts synthesis in connecting various data points, these efforts lack depth and specificity. The valuation section presents standard DCF assumptions without novel drivers or mechanisms. Most insights are generic and applicable to any life sciences company rather than being TMO-specific. The few attempts at original analysis are undermined by extensive copying from sources and lack of decision-relevant catalysts or timing.",
