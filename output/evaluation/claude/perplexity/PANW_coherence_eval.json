    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and consistency problems that undermine its coherence. The document reads like a collection of disconnected sections with minimal cross-referencing and numerous internal contradictions. Most critically, the financials table projects EPS jumping from $1.74 in FY 2024 to $6.33 in FY 2025 - a 264% increase - yet the narrative discusses only 15% revenue growth with no explanation for this massive earnings acceleration. The fair value estimate of $210 lacks supporting DCF calculations despite claiming DCF methodology. Temporal inconsistencies abound, with the August 4, 2025 report date referencing Q3 2025 results from May 20, 2025, creating impossible chronology. The Bulls/Bears section fails to reconcile opposing viewpoints with the base case valuation. Multiple sections read as bullet-point lists without smooth transitions, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections. The report cites 24 sources but many claims lack proper attribution, and several sections contain unsupported assertions about market size and competitive positioning that don't align with cited materials.",
