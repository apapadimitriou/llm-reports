    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are largely opaque and scattered throughout without clear connection to forecasts. While some key metrics are mentioned (6-7% NII growth, $4B tech spending, 11.8% CET1 ratio), they lack proper justification with multi-year history or peer benchmarks. Critical valuation inputs like the 9.2% cost of equity and 11.5x P/E multiple appear without supporting evidence. The financial projections table shows specific EPS and revenue figures through 2029 but provides no methodology or underlying assumptions for these forecasts. Most importantly, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers. The assumptions that do appear are often vague regarding time horizons and causal mechanisms. While the report mentions some historical context, it fails to explicitly link past performance to future projections in a systematic way.",
