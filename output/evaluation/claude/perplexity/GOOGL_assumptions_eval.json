    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates poor quality of assumptions across all five evaluation pillars. While the document provides extensive narrative content, key modeling assumptions are largely unstated or opaque. Critical drivers like WACC (8.4%), terminal growth (3.0%), and specific revenue growth rates appear only in a brief appendix without justification or supporting evidence. The financial projections table presents precise figures through 2029 but lacks explanation of underlying drivers or methodology. No sensitivity analysis or scenario testing is provided for any material assumptions. Internal consistency issues exist between narrative claims and quantified projections. The assumptions fail to meet basic standards for explicitness, justification, and stress-testing required for equity research.",
