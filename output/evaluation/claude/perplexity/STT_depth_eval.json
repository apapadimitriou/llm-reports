    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains extensive data and some quantified metrics, it lacks causal mechanisms explaining performance drivers. Key weaknesses include: no explicit valuation assumptions or benchmarking (\"WACC: 9.2%\" and \"Terminal growth rate: 2.5%\" are stated without justification), absence of sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling, and generic forward-looking statements without supporting logic. The report provides correlation-based observations like \"Fee revenue growth of 6% year-over-year\" but fails to explain underlying drivers. Investment implications are vague rather than actionable. Examples of weak reasoning: \"Fee revenue growth: 4-6% annually\" (unsupported range), \"Target ROE: 13-14%\" (no benchmark), \"Medium ESG risk\" (no quantified impact). The extensive formatting cannot compensate for the lack of analytical rigor in causal reasoning and uncertainty analysis.",
