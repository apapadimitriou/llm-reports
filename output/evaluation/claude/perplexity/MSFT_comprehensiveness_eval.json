    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards with critical structural deficiencies. Most importantly, it completely lacks a Financials Snapshot with actual sector-specific KPIs for technology companies (no ARR, NRR, cloud metrics, or detailed segment breakdowns beyond basic revenue/EPS). The valuation section provides a fair value estimate but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to valuation assumptions - it mentions DCF methodology but doesn't show the actual calculation bridge from AI growth assumptions to the $490 target price. Multiple core sections are entirely missing including Competitive Positioning analysis, detailed Bulls/Bears arguments, and proper peer benchmarking. While the report mentions some financial figures, it lacks the depth and analytical rigor expected for equity research, reading more like a general business overview than comprehensive investment analysis.",
