    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report suffers from fundamental structural deficiencies that render it incomplete and unreliable. Most critically, the entire document appears to be fabricated with fictional future dates (2025-2026) and impossible financial projections, violating basic research integrity standards. The report lacks essential sections including competitive positioning analysis, peer benchmarking, and scenario analysis. While it attempts to cover major topics like business description and valuation, the sector-specific KPIs are inadequately developed - missing critical cybersecurity metrics like customer acquisition costs, churn rates, and security incident response times. The financial snapshot provides basic revenue/EPS projections but omits key SaaS metrics like ARR breakdown, net revenue retention details, and customer cohort analysis. Most damaging, the extensive source list appears fabricated with future publication dates, creating a facade of credibility while providing no actual evidentiary support. The valuation section mentions DCF methodology but fails to show explicit linkages between operating drivers and fair value calculations.",
