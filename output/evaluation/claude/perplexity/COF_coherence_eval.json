    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and content coherence issues that make it difficult to follow as a unified analysis. The document contains multiple fundamental contradictions, particularly around financial performance claims. The narrative states Q1 2025 showed 'normalized profitability of $1.4 billion' while simultaneously claiming Q2 2025 revenue declined '81% year-over-year,' but these figures are never reconciled or explained within a coherent timeline. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints without any connection to the base-case valuation assumptions presented elsewhere. Most critically, several sections read as disconnected bullet-point lists rather than flowing analysis, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections which jump between topics without transitions. The financial projections table shows dramatic swings (EPS from $2.15 to $20.12) that are never adequately explained in the narrative. Temporal references are inconsistent, with 'recent' events spanning different timeframes without clear dating. The report requires readers to independently construct the analytical framework rather than following a coherent argument.",
