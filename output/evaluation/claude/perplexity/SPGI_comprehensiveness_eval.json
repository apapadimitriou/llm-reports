    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards with multiple critical deficiencies. Most sections are completely missing or skeletal, including no Bulls/Bears section, no competitive positioning analysis, no peer benchmarking, and no scenario analysis. The Financials Snapshot lacks essential sector-specific KPIs for financial services (no AUM growth rates, fee margins, client retention metrics, or subscription revenue metrics). The valuation section provides assumptions but fails to explicitly link operating drivers to fair value calculations. Numerous material claims are completely uncited, including all financial projections, margin expansion assumptions, and market share assertions. The report exhibits significant redundancy, repeating IHS Markit integration benefits and competitive advantages across multiple sections without adding depth. Sources are listed but not properly cited in-text throughout the analysis.",
