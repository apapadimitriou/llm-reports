    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are severely deficient across all quality dimensions. Key financial projections lack any justification - revenue jumping from $27.4B to $42.8B with no explanation, EPS forecasts with no methodology, and a $245 fair value estimate with no supporting calculations despite claiming DCF analysis. Critical valuation inputs like 9.5% WACC and 2.5% terminal growth are stated without sources or derivation. The report contains multiple contradictions: claims normalized earnings recovery by 2026 while projecting $2.15 EPS, states 7.0-7.3% NIM targets but provides no current baseline, and mentions $1.2B synergies without quantification methodology. No sensitivity analysis exists for any material drivers. Most assumptions appear in an appendix without connection to the forecasts they supposedly drive. The analysis reads more like a business overview than a rigorous financial model with auditable assumptions.",
