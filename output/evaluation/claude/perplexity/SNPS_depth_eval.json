    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is predominantly descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some basic causal statements like 'revenue of $1.604 billion, exceeding guidance midpoint' and 'Design IP revenue surged 21% year-over-year to $482 million', these lack explanatory mechanisms. The valuation section presents assumptions such as '8-10% organic growth' and '28x forward price-to-earnings multiple' but provides no benchmarking, sensitivity analysis, or stress testing. The financial projections show specific numbers but offer no underlying drivers or scenarios. Key analytical gaps include no explanation of how AI tool adoption translates to financial performance, no quantified impact scenarios for China restrictions beyond basic revenue decline, and no sensitivity analysis around the critical Ansys integration assumptions. The report reads more like a comprehensive summary than rigorous analysis.",
