    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report suffers from severe structural and consistency issues that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The document reads as a collection of disconnected sections with minimal transitional flow and contains multiple unresolved contradictions. Most critically, the fair value estimate of $770 contradicts the last close price of $769.30 while providing no meaningful differentiation or investment recommendation. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints without any reconciliation to the base-case valuation narrative. Temporal inconsistencies are pervasive, with the report dated June 16, 2025 but referencing Q1 2025 results as recent while discussing Q2 guidance, creating confusion about the analysis timeframe. Many sections read like bullet-point lists without connecting arguments - particularly the Business Strategy, Risk sections, and ESG discussion. The financial projections table lacks supporting methodology in the narrative, and key assumptions appear disconnected from the qualitative analysis. Citations are present but often don't clearly support the specific claims made. The overall structure exists but individual sections fail to build upon each other cohesively.",
