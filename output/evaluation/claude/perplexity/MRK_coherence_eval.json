    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and consistency problems that fundamentally undermine its coherence. The temporal framework is fundamentally broken, presenting Q2 2025 results as historical data while writing from an August 2025 perspective, creating impossible chronological claims throughout. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists without meaningful transitions, particularly the Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, and Risk sections. The Bulls/Bears analysis presents competing viewpoints but fails to reconcile them with the base case valuation narrative, leaving readers unable to understand how the $111 fair value estimate accounts for the patent cliff concerns. Most critically, the financial projections table contains internal contradictions - showing revenue declining from $72.1B to $68.5B (2028-2029) while EPS only drops from $9.85 to $8.12, implying margin expansion during a patent cliff that contradicts the narrative's 35-50% erosion assumptions. The report requires readers to independently construct logical connections between sections rather than providing a coherent analytical framework.",
