    "summary_reasoning": "This report fundamentally fails the quality of assumptions assessment across all five pillars. Assumptions are largely unstated and opaque throughout\u2014the financial model presents detailed projections through 2029 without explicitly stating the key drivers. Revenue growth assumptions of 12.8% CAGR appear only in the appendix without justification. Critical inputs like WACC (8.5%), terminal growth (3%), and operating margin expansion to 25.8% lack any supporting evidence, peer benchmarks, or historical context. The fair value estimate of $144.55 contradicts the narrative analysis suggesting current prices reflect 'optimistic expectations' at $171.85, yet no sensitivity analysis quantifies this disconnect. No scenario testing exists for material drivers like AI revenue scaling, regulatory impacts, or competitive pressures despite these being highlighted as key risks. The assumptions are scattered, unjustified, and provide no quantified ranges for the 'tens of billions' AI revenue target or the $1.5B regulatory impact\u2014making the model effectively a black box.",
