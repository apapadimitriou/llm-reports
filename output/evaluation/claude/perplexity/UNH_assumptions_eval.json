    "summary_reasoning": "The report fundamentally fails on assumption quality across all five pillars. Explicitness is severely lacking\u2014key valuation inputs like the 15-16x P/E multiple, 8-9% WACC, and normalized 82-84% medical care ratio appear only in a brief appendix without context or derivation. Justification is virtually absent, with critical assumptions like '$3-4 billion earnings improvement' and '$25-27 per share by 2027-2028' presented without supporting analysis, peer comparisons, or historical basis. Specificity is poor\u2014revenue growth projections of '7-9% annually' and 'approximately 2-3% share count reductions' lack precision and causal drivers. Internal consistency shows major contradictions: the financials table projects 16.50 EPS for 2025E while text discusses 'at least $14.65 per share' guidance. Most critically, sensitivity analysis is completely absent\u2014no quantified scenarios test key drivers like medical cost ratios, regulatory impact, or competitive pressures despite acknowledging high uncertainty. The assumptions driving the $375-432 fair value range are opaque and unsubstantiated.",
