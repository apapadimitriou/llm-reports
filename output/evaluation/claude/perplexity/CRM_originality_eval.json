    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates minimal originality, consisting primarily of restated financial data and generic commentary. The analysis lacks synthesis of information into unique insights or original theses. Key sections like valuation rely on standard DCF assumptions without novel drivers or mechanisms. The 'Bulls Say/Bears Say' section presents conventional perspectives available in any basic equity research. Financial projections appear formulaic without company-specific rationale. While the report shows comprehensive coverage of Salesforce's business, it fails to provide value-added analysis that goes beyond paraphrasing publicly available information. No meaningful synthesis connects multiple data points into new conclusions, and most insights are generic enough to apply to any large software company.",
