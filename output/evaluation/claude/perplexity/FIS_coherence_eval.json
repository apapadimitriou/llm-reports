    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits numerous critical coherence failures that severely undermine its readability and credibility. The document contains fundamental structural contradictions, starting with a glaring mismatch between the cover block showing a 2025-06-24 report date but sources dated as late as June 24, 2025, creating temporal impossibility. The financial snapshot presents fabricated projections through 2029 with precise figures that have no basis in the provided sources, directly contradicting the instruction to use only provided content. Multiple sections read as disconnected bullet lists with minimal transitions, particularly the Business Strategy and Risk sections. The Bulls/Bears analysis lacks reconciliation with the base-case valuation narrative, presenting conflicting views without resolution. Critical terminology inconsistencies appear throughout, with switching between 'recurring revenue growth' percentages and mixing EBITDA with EPS metrics inappropriately. The report attempts to present a comprehensive analysis but fails to maintain internal logical consistency, forcing readers to assemble the argument themselves rather than following a coherent analytical thread.",

        "Bulls Say section claims 'acceleration of recurring revenue growth to 4% from previous levels of 2%' while Bears Say section cites 'modest 4% revenue growth' without reconciling these perspectives with base-case valuation"
