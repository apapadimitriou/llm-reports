    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is fundamentally descriptive with minimal analytical depth. While it contains some quantified projections like \"15-17% reported sales growth\" and \"$200 million tariff impact,\" these lack causal mechanisms or supporting assumptions. The financial forecasts show revenue growing from $16.7B to $33.6B over five years with no explanation of underlying drivers or methodology. Key statements like \"Operating margin expanded to 16.2%, up 3.6 percentage points\" describe what happened but not why. The valuation section mentions \"12-15% annually through 2029\" and \"8.5% discount rate\" but provides no benchmarking, sensitivity analysis, or alternative scenarios. Most critically, there are no quantified sensitivities, stress tests, or ranges around any assumptions. The report reads more like a comprehensive company overview than rigorous equity analysis.",
