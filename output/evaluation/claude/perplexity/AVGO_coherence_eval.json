    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and coherence problems that undermine its credibility as a professional equity research document. The document contains multiple fundamental contradictions, most notably claiming to be a Q2 2025 report while using future dates throughout (e.g., 'Report date: 2025-06-26' in a supposed current analysis). The financial projections table spans impossible timeframes, showing both actual and estimated data for years that contradict the report's stated temporal context. Section flow is extremely choppy with abrupt topic transitions and minimal connective tissue between paragraphs. The Bulls/Bears section presents arguments but fails to reconcile them with the base-case valuation narrative, leaving readers to resolve tensions independently. Key terminology is inconsistently applied, and the report reads more like assembled bullet points than a coherent analytical argument. The temporal framework is fundamentally broken, with 'recent' claims referring to events that appear disconnected from the report's own dating system. These issues collectively render the report internally inconsistent and difficult to follow as a unified investment thesis.",
