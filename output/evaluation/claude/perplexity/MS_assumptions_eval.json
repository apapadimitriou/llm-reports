    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report completely lacks the foundational elements required for equity research. No financial modeling assumptions are provided - no WACC components, no specific revenue growth rates by segment, no margin assumptions, no share count projections. The 'Financials Snapshot' table presents unexplained projections without any supporting assumptions. The fair value estimate of $145 mentions 'key model assumptions' but provides only vague ranges (6-8% revenue growth, 28-30% margins) without justification from history, peers, or sources. Critical valuation drivers like cost of equity, terminal growth rate, and specific segment assumptions are either missing or buried in an appendix without context. No sensitivity analysis exists despite the report acknowledging market volatility as a key risk. The assumptions are fundamentally opaque, making the analysis unauditable and unreliable for investment decisions.",
