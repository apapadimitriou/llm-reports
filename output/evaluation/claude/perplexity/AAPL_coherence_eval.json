    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "This report exhibits severe structural and content coherence problems that fundamentally undermine its credibility. Most critically, the report is dated June 9, 2025, yet extensively cites future events and sources from dates that haven't occurred yet, including sources dated through July 2025. This creates impossible temporal contradictions throughout. The narrative contains multiple unresolved contradictions, such as describing iPhone revenue as both \"continuing its gradual decline\" while simultaneously showing revenue growth in the financial projections table. The Bulls/Bears section presents opposing viewpoints but fails to reconcile these with the base-case valuation narrative. Many sections read as disconnected bullet-point lists without smooth transitions, particularly the Business Description and Risk sections. The report lacks explicit cross-references between key sections like assumptions and valuation methodology. Source citations frequently don't align with claims made, and the extensive use of future-dated sources from a June 2025 report creates fundamental credibility issues that make the entire analysis incoherent.",
