    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report severely lacks explicit assumptions driving its forecasts and valuations. While it provides extensive qualitative analysis, the critical quantitative assumptions are buried in an appendix table without justification or context. The fair value estimate of $261.18 appears with no supporting methodology, WACC calculation, or derivation process. Key drivers like revenue growth rates, margin expansion trajectories, and terminal values lack historical benchmarking or peer comparisons. The financial projections span 2025-2029 with precise figures but no explanation of underlying assumptions. Most critically, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers. The report reads more like a comprehensive business overview than a rigorous valuation analysis with auditable assumptions.",
