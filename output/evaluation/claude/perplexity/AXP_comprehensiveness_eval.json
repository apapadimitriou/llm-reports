    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards across multiple dimensions. Critical sections are entirely missing, including Competitive Positioning, which is essential for equity research. The Financials Snapshot lacks fundamental sector-specific KPIs for financial services (Net Interest Margin, Return on Equity, Tier 1 Capital Ratio, Credit Loss Provisions, Book Value per Share), presenting only generic metrics. The Fair Value section provides a target price but completely fails to establish explicit linkages between operating drivers and valuation methodology - there's no DCF model detail, multiple justification, or sensitivity analysis. Peer benchmarking is absent throughout. Many claims lack proper citations, and the report demonstrates significant structural gaps that render it incomplete for investment decision-making purposes.",
