    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails fundamental assumption quality standards across all five pillars. Key financial assumptions are almost entirely absent\u2014no explicit revenue growth rates, margin targets, WACC components, or terminal growth rates appear in the narrative sections. The financial snapshot table provides projections without any justification or explanation of underlying drivers. Critical assumptions like the 9.5% WACC and 3% terminal growth only appear buried in an appendix with no supporting rationale. Multiple internal contradictions exist: management targets 'at least $1.5 billion' in buybacks while the model assumes 1.5% annual share reduction; revenue growth assumptions of 8-10% contradict the implied 8.2% CAGR from the financials table. The report contains no sensitivity analysis or scenario testing despite discussing significant regulatory risks and market uncertainties. While the report demonstrates strong research and comprehensive coverage, the assumptions driving the $1,200 fair value estimate are opaque and unjustified.",
