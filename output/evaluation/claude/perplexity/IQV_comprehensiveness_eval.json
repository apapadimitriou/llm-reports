    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report fails to meet basic comprehensiveness standards for equity research. While it includes most expected sections structurally, the content is severely deficient in several critical areas. The valuation section completely lacks explicit linkage from operating drivers to the $197 fair value estimate, with no DCF model details, sensitivity analysis, or clear methodology. The financials snapshot omits essential sector KPIs for life sciences companies (R&D intensity, backlog conversion rates, utilization rates, organic growth rates). Multiple material claims are entirely uncited, including the fair value estimate itself and all forward projections. The report contains significant redundancy, repeating AI capabilities and backlog figures across multiple sections without adding depth. Peer benchmarking is completely absent despite this being standard for CRO industry analysis.",
