    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates significant structural deficiencies that render it incomplete as an equity research document. While it includes many expected sections like Analyst Note, Business Description, and Valuation, critical content areas are either missing or severely underdeveloped. The Financials Snapshot completely lacks essential banking sector KPIs including Net Interest Margin (NIM), Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), loan loss provisions, and regulatory capital ratios like Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1). The peer benchmarking analysis is entirely absent, providing no competitive context for valuation or performance assessment. The Bulls/Bears section lacks quantitative depth and specific data points. Most critically, the valuation methodology fails to establish explicit linkages between operating drivers and the $85 fair value estimate, presenting assumptions without clear mathematical bridges. The report also suffers from redundancy, with commercial real estate risks and regulatory relief themes repeated across multiple sections without adding new analytical depth.",
