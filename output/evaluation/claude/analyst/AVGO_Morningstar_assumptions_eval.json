    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates good explicitness with key assumptions clearly stated, particularly AI revenue growth rates (40%+ CAGR through fiscal 2029) and operating margin targets (mid-60% range by fiscal 2029). Justification is solid, referencing management's serviceable addressable market estimates ($60-90 billion by fiscal 2027) and historical performance trends. Specificity is strong with clear units, timeframes, and growth rates provided. However, the report is capped at Fair due to the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers. While the narrative mentions risks and uncertainty around AI spending patterns and customer concentration, no numerical ranges or stress-test scenarios are provided for revenue growth, margins, or valuation drivers. Internal consistency appears clean with no contradictions identified between forecasts and narrative.",
