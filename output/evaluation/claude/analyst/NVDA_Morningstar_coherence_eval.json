    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This NVIDIA equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and logical flow. The narrative arc progresses naturally from the analyst note announcing the H20 ban reversal through business strategy, valuation methodology, and risk assessment. Sections effectively cross-reference each other, particularly between the analyst note's fair value increase and the detailed valuation section. The Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case narrative, acknowledging both AI dominance potential and competitive threats. Financial tables consistently support the narrative assumptions about revenue growth and margin expansion. Terminology is used consistently throughout, and temporal references align with the report dates. The report maintains internal consistency between assumptions (H20 sales resumption, China revenue reinsertion) and conclusions (fair value increase to $170). Minor areas for improvement include some transitions that could be smoother and occasional dense technical explanations, but these don't materially detract from the overall coherent argument structure.",
    "evidence": [
        "Clear cross-referencing between analyst note fair value increase 'to $170 from $140' and detailed valuation section showing same $170 target with explicit China revenue assumptions",
        "Bulls/Bears section properly reconciled with base case, acknowledging both 'industry-leading GPUs and Cuda software platform' strengths and 'powerful chipmakers focused on in-house chip development' competitive risks",
        "Financial assumptions align with narrative - '$5 billion of revenue to October and January quarters' and '$30 billion into fiscal 2027' matching H20 ban reversal impact discussed in analyst note"
