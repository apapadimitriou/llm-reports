    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This ServiceNow report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal explanations and explicit assumptions. The analyst provides detailed causal reasoning such as \"driven by solid renewals, generative AI, and customer workflow adoption\" and \"Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.7%\". Key assumptions are quantified and benchmarked, including \"five-year CAGR for revenue of 18%\", \"cost of capital ~9.0%\", and \"operating margin expanding from 30% to mid-30% area\". The DCF model includes specific inputs: \"Stage II EBI Growth Rate 14.4%\" and \"WACC 8.8%\". However, the report lacks comprehensive scenario analysis or sensitivity testing around these assumptions. While it mentions risks like \"rapid growth will inevitably slow\" and competitive threats, it doesn't quantify alternative outcomes or provide ranges for key metrics. The implications are actionable with clear investment recommendations, but the analysis would benefit from more robust stress-testing of assumptions.",
