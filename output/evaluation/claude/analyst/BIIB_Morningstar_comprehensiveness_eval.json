    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Biogen equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across all major sections expected for biopharma analysis. The report includes detailed business description, strategic outlook, competitive positioning, valuation with explicit DCF modeling, risk assessment, and capital allocation analysis. The financials snapshot provides multi-year historical and forecast data with key biopharma metrics including drug-specific revenue forecasts, pipeline analysis, and partnership royalties. The valuation section effectively links operating drivers (MS franchise decline, Leqembi ramp, Spinraza competition) to fair value assumptions through detailed DCF analysis. Evidence citations are consistent throughout, and ESG considerations are appropriately integrated. While peer benchmarking is limited to one competitor and scenario analysis is not explicitly presented, the report's depth of drug-by-drug analysis, regulatory considerations, and market dynamics more than compensates for these minor gaps.",
