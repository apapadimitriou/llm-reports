    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid assumption quality across key dimensions. Explicit assumptions include specific growth rates (EDA segment 11% CAGR, IP segment 13% CAGR, overall 12% CAGR through 2029), margin expansion targets (22% to 31% by 2034), and a clearly stated 7.5% cost of equity. These assumptions are well-justified through historical performance, peer comparisons, and detailed industry analysis. The specificity is strong with clear units, timeframes, and drivers linked to AI demand, chip complexity, and systems company adoption. Internal consistency is maintained between narrative and financial tables. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like growth rates, margins, or discount rates, which caps the grade at Good despite otherwise comprehensive assumption work.",
