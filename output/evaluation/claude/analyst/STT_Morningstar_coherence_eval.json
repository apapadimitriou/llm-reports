    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and logical flow. The narrative builds systematically from the analyst note through business strategy, valuation, and risk assessment. Sections effectively cross-reference each other, with the analyst note connecting to stress test implications, business strategy aligning with moat analysis, and bulls/bears points reconciling well with the base-case outlook. The financial tables accurately support the narrative projections, and terminology is used consistently throughout. Temporal references are precise, with the June 27, 2025 stress test results appropriately described as recent relative to the June 29 report date. The analyst notes archive provides helpful context and maintains consistency with the main analysis. While there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother, such as between some subsections in the moat analysis, these do not materially detract from the report's coherence. The overvaluation concern mentioned in the analyst note is well-integrated with the fair value analysis and risk discussion.",
