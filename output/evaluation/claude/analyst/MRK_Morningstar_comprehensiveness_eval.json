    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across most expected sections with appropriate pharmaceutical sector KPIs. The report includes all major sections: executive summary, business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with profit drivers, risk analysis, capital allocation, comprehensive financials with multi-year forecasts, ESG coverage, and detailed appendix. The financials section is particularly robust with pharmaceutical-appropriate metrics including revenue growth, operating margins, R&D spending ratios, and pipeline-specific KPIs. The valuation section effectively links operating drivers (particularly Keytruda sales trajectory and pipeline development) to the DCF model assumptions. Peer benchmarking is present with competitive analysis of Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. However, the report lacks explicit scenario analysis or sensitivity testing around key assumptions like Keytruda patent cliff timing or alternative pipeline success rates, which prevents it from achieving an 'Excellent' rating.",
