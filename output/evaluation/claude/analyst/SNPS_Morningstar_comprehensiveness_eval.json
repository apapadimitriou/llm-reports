    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive equity research report covers all major sections expected for institutional analysis. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit DCF methodology, risk analysis, capital allocation evaluation, and extensive financial projections. The financials snapshot provides multi-year historical and forecast data with sector-appropriate KPIs including revenue growth, operating margins, ROIC, and EDA-specific metrics like design starts and IP segment performance. Peer benchmarking compares Synopsys with Cadence and Siemens across key valuation metrics. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (AI demand, chip complexity, systems company adoption) to fair value assumptions through detailed DCF analysis. Sources are consistently cited throughout, and ESG considerations are appropriately integrated. While the report lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case DCF, the comprehensive coverage, strong analytical depth, and clear linkage between business drivers and valuation justify a Good rating.",
