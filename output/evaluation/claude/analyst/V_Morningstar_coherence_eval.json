    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Morningstar equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and well-structured sections that reinforce each other effectively. The narrative flows logically from the stablecoin threat analysis in the Analyst Note through business strategy, competitive positioning, and valuation methodology. Key terms like 'wide moat,' 'cross-border volume,' and 'client incentives' are used consistently throughout. The report successfully connects assumptions across sections - the fair value estimate of $306 aligns with projected growth rates and margin expectations, while the Bulls/Bears section appropriately balances the base-case narrative about network effects and scalability against regulatory risks and market saturation concerns. Financial projections in the tables align well with the narrative discussion of 10% revenue growth and modest margin expansion. However, there are some minor rough edges that prevent an excellent rating, including occasional abrupt transitions between topics and some sections that could benefit from stronger connective tissue between key points.",
