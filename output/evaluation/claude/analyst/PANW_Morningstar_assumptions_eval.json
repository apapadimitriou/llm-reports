{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid explicitness with key assumptions clearly stated in the Fair Value section, including specific growth rates (17% CAGR), margin targets (low-80s gross margins, high-30s adjusted margins), and valuation multiples (15x EV/sales). Justification is partial, relying on general industry trends and historical performance patterns rather than detailed peer comparisons or external sources. Specificity is good with clear units, timeframes, and drivers provided for most assumptions. Internal consistency appears clean with no contradictions identified between narrative and financial tables. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers, offering only a single bear case scenario with limited detail. While assumptions are well-articulated and reasonably supported, the absence of robust sensitivity analysis caps the grade at Fair per the methodology.",
