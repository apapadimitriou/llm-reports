    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go well beyond generic industry commentary. The analyst provides detailed, quantified insights connecting Farapulse adoption rates (172% EP growth, triple-digit quarterly growth) to competitive disruption in atrial fibrillation ablation, with specific mechanisms like shorter procedure times and safety profiles driving physician preference. The synthesis linking Boston's early PFA market entry to sustainable competitive advantage over Abbott and J&J is particularly compelling, supported by concrete data points and timing catalysts. The valuation incorporates novel drivers including tariff impacts ($200M), specific product integration timelines (Faraview software, Farawave navigation), and quantified margin trajectories (27% operating margin by 2029). While some standard DCF elements appear, the core insights around technology disruption, competitive positioning, and growth catalysts are highly decision-relevant and company-specific.",
