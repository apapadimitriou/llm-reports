    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Arista Networks report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across most expected sections. It includes all major components: executive summary, business description, strategy/outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with profit drivers, risk analysis, capital allocation, and extensive financial snapshots with multi-year forecasts. The report provides sector-appropriate KPIs including revenue growth rates, operating margins, EBITDA margins, and return metrics (ROA, ROE, ROIC) relevant to technology hardware companies. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers like AI networking growth and market share gains to financial projections and fair value estimates. Peer competitive analysis is present with detailed comparisons to Dell, Cisco, and HPE. However, the report lacks formal scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case DCF model, preventing an 'Excellent' rating. Sources are consistently cited throughout with specific dates and analyst attributions.",
