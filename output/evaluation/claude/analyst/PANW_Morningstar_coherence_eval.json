    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Palo Alto Networks equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and logical flow. The narrative successfully connects the CyberArk acquisition analysis in the opening analyst note to the broader strategic themes of platformization and vendor consolidation discussed throughout. The Business Strategy & Outlook section smoothly transitions into Bulls/Bears arguments, which are well-reconciled with the base-case valuation narrative emphasizing secular tailwinds and platform benefits. The Economic Moat section provides detailed support for the wide moat rating with specific examples of switching costs and network effects. Financial projections in the valuation tables align consistently with the narrative assumptions about margin expansion and growth rates. Terminology is used consistently throughout, and temporal references are accurate relative to the report dates. While some transitions between subsections could be slightly smoother, and the extensive analyst notes archive creates some repetition, these are minor issues that don't significantly detract from the report's overall coherence.",
