    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid explicitness with key assumptions clearly stated in the Fair Value section and detailed financial tables. Justification is partial, with some assumptions supported by historical context (e.g., pricing compression trends, NII volatility) but lacking peer benchmarks or external sources for critical inputs like the 9% cost of equity. Specificity is good with clear units, timeframes, and growth rates provided throughout the forecast tables. Internal consistency appears clean with no obvious contradictions between narrative and tables. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like NII growth, fee compression, or cost of equity changes. While qualitative risks are discussed extensively, there are no quantified ranges or stress tests for key valuation inputs, which caps the grade at Fair per the methodology.",
