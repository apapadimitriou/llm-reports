    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Bank of America equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language and logical flow throughout most sections. The narrative arc progresses smoothly from analyst note to business strategy, valuation, and risks, with sections effectively cross-referencing each other. The Business Strategy section explicitly connects to the Economic Moat analysis, which in turn supports the Fair Value section's assumptions about returns on tangible equity. The Bulls/Bears arguments align well with the base-case narrative, particularly around rate sensitivity and NII growth potential. Financial projections in the valuation model are consistent with the qualitative discussion of expense growth, NII expansion, and efficiency improvements. Terminology is used consistently throughout, and temporal references appear accurate relative to the report dates. While some transitions between subsections could be smoother and a few claims could use stronger support, the overall argument holds together cohesively without material contradictions.",
    "evidence": [
        "Clear cross-referencing between sections, such as Fair Value section stating 'we project NII to grow by around 6.8% in 2025' which aligns with the Business Strategy discussion of NII expansion",
        "Bulls/Bears arguments properly reconciled with base case, with Bears noting 'If the economy ever falters and rates are cut' connecting to valuation assumptions about rate sensitivity",
        "Valuation model projections (efficiency ratio improving to high-50s, 2.5% expense growth) consistent with narrative discussion of expense control and operational improvements"
