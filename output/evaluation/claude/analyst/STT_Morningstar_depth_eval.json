    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms linking business drivers to financial outcomes. The analyst provides explicit causal explanations such as \"NII peaked in Q4 2022\" due to \"Federal Reserve raising interest rates\" and notes that \"rapid rise in interest rates during 2022 helped custody banks expand net interest income.\" Key assumptions are quantified and benchmarked, including \"cost of equity 9.0%\", \"Stage II growth rate 4.0%\", and \"ROICs fade to cost of capital.\" The report acknowledges pricing pressures with \"pricing compression of 4% in 2018-2019\" moderating to \"2% headwind in 2020-23.\" However, while the report contains some scenario considerations like \"if markets fall from current levels could weigh on fees\" and discusses uncertainty around \"market levels, foreign-exchange volume,\" it lacks comprehensive quantified sensitivity analysis or detailed scenario modeling that would elevate it to excellent grade.",
