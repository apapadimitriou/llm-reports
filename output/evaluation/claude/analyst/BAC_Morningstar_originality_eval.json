    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic banking commentary. Key strengths include: (1) A detailed synthesis linking BAC's unique balance sheet positioning (duration risk in securities portfolio) to specific NII growth projections (6.8% in 2025, reaching $15.6B quarterly by year-end), (2) Quantified analysis of stress test implications showing 40-65 basis point capital buffer reductions translating to 5% of market cap in potential excess capital returns, (3) Company-specific deposit cost analysis showing consumer deposits at 0.64% vs. global banking at 2.97%, and (4) Integration of technological investment ($10B annual tech budget) with competitive positioning. The valuation section provides novel drivers including specific NIM expansion forecasts and efficiency ratio improvements to high-50s. While some sections contain standard moat framework language, the core analytical insights are decision-relevant and quantified with clear catalysts.",
