    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong originality through multiple company-specific syntheses and one clear original thesis. Key syntheses include: (1) linking FIS's operational missteps in SMB space to Worldpay's underperformance rather than flawed strategic rationale, (2) connecting the GTCR partnership structure to reduced transparency while providing needed private investment, and (3) analyzing how cost synergy unwinding from divestiture offset by management cost reductions creates margin dynamics. The original thesis that FIS's large bank customer concentration creates greater bargaining leverage disadvantage versus peers is quantified and decision-relevant. The valuation incorporates novel drivers including specific margin expansion rates (40 basis points annually) and segment-specific growth projections. While some standard moat analysis appears, the core insights are company-specific and actionable for investment decisions.",
