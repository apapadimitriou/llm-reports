    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms and explicit, quantified assumptions. The analyst provides strong causal explanations such as \"AI chip revenue rose 46% year over year\" and \"revenue rose 20% year over year\" with specific drivers identified. Key assumptions are explicitly stated and benchmarked, including \"WACC ~8.8%\", \"Stage II EBI Growth Rate 8.0%\", and \"Long-Run Tax Rate 13.0%\". The report shows good quantification with specific forecasts like \"$50 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2027\" and \"20% revenue growth through fiscal 2029\". However, while the report mentions various scenarios and acknowledges uncertainty with statements like \"There are upside and downside risks to this range\", it lacks comprehensive quantified sensitivity analysis or detailed scenario modeling that would elevate it to excellent. The actionable implications are present but could be more conditional and decision-specific.",
