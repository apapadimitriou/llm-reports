    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Mastercard report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal explanations and quantified assumptions. The analyst provides strong causal reasoning throughout, explaining that \"revenue declined in 2020 due to the coronavirus\" and projecting \"net revenue to grow at a 12% compound annual growth rate\" with explicit drivers tied to international markets and secular trends. Key assumptions are quantified and benchmarked: \"cost of equity of 9%\", \"operating margins to improve from 58% in 2024 to 61% by 2029\", and \"31.6 times projected 2025 earnings\". The report acknowledges uncertainty with statements like \"tariffs create significant near-term uncertainty\" and discusses various risk scenarios including regulatory fines and competitive threats. However, the analysis lacks comprehensive scenario modeling or quantified sensitivity analysis around key assumptions, preventing an Excellent rating despite strong foundational reasoning.",
