    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Morningstar report covers all major sections expected for equity research with appropriate depth. The report includes detailed analyst note, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, extensive economic moat discussion, valuation methodology with DCF model, risk assessment, and capital allocation analysis. The financials snapshot provides multi-year history and forecasts with sector-appropriate KPIs including average daily volume, revenue per contract, and trading volumes by asset class. Peer benchmarking is present with comparative analysis of ICE, NDAQ, and Deutsche Boerse. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (trading volume, volatility, interest rates) to fair value assumptions through detailed DCF methodology. Sources are consistently cited throughout. Minor limitations include lack of explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis tables and some repetitive content across quarterly earnings updates, but overall coverage is thorough and well-integrated.",
