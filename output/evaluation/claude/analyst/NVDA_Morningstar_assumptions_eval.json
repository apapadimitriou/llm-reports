    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid assumption quality across most pillars. Key assumptions are explicitly stated and proximal to forecasts, including specific DC revenue projections ($182B fiscal 2026, $246B fiscal 2027), gross margin targets (71% fiscal 2026, 74% fiscal 2027), and detailed growth rates with clear time horizons. Justification is strong, referencing multi-year historical performance (DC growth from $3B to $115B fiscal 2020-2025) and management guidance. The WACC of 9.0% and terminal growth assumptions are clearly specified in the valuation table. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like revenue growth, margins, or cost of capital, which caps the grade at Good despite otherwise comprehensive assumption disclosure.",
