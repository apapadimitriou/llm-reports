    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This PNC Financial Services equity research report demonstrates strong structural coherence and clear narrative flow. The report follows a logical progression from recent stress test results through business strategy, valuation methodology, and risk assessment. Sections effectively cross-reference each other, with the Economic Moat analysis supporting the Fair Value estimates, and the Bulls/Bears perspectives aligning well with the base-case assumptions. The language is clear and professional throughout, with consistent use of banking terminology. Transitions between sections are smooth, and the analyst maintains a cohesive argument about PNC's narrow moat rating based on scale advantages and BBVA acquisition benefits. The financial projections in the valuation tables align with the narrative assumptions about NII growth, efficiency improvements, and credit normalization. Temporal references are accurate, with recent events like the June 2025 stress tests properly contextualized. The report successfully integrates quantitative forecasts with qualitative analysis, creating a unified investment thesis. Minor areas for improvement include some dense technical sections that could benefit from smoother transitions, but overall the report reads as a well-connected analytical framework.",
    "evidence": [
        "Analyst Note section seamlessly connects stress test results to capital return implications, demonstrating explicit cross-referencing: 'Lower capital requirements correspond with higher leverage and higher returns for banks' (Page 1)",
        "Economic Moat analysis directly supports Fair Value assumptions, with BBVA acquisition driving efficiency ratio improvements from 'often struggled to break 60%' to expected '58% over time' (Page 5)",
        "Bulls/Bears section reconciles with base-case valuation narrative, acknowledging both BBVA value creation potential and current overvaluation concerns at 1.03 Price/FVE (Page 3)"
