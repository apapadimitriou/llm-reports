    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong causal reasoning with explicit mechanisms linking business drivers to outcomes. Key causal explanations include \"driven by higher yielding assets\" and \"ETF platform maintaining leading market share\" driving AUM growth. The analysis provides quantified assumptions with benchmarks, including \"9% cost of equity\" and specific P/E multiples of \"23.1 times 2025 earnings\" versus historical averages of \"20.3 times trailing earnings.\" Growth projections are well-supported: \"4.4% average annual organic AUM growth during 2025-29\" with clear drivers like \"recovery in equity flows\" and \"uptick in bond fund flows.\" The report includes scenario analysis with bull-case \"$1,630 per share\" and bear-case \"$630 per share\" valuations, though sensitivity testing is limited. Operating margin forecasts of \"43%-47% range during 2025-29\" are benchmarked against historical \"44.1% average.\" However, the analysis lacks extensive quantified sensitivity analysis around key assumptions like market corrections or fee compression rates, preventing an Excellent rating.",
