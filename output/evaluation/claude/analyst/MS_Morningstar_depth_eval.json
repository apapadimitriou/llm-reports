    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms linking business drivers to financial outcomes. The analyst provides explicit, quantified assumptions including \"net revenue compound annual growth rate of over 2.5%,\" \"6%-8% compound annual growth rate\" for AUM growth, and \"cost of equity of 9%.\" These assumptions are benchmarked against management targets like \"expense ratio of less than 70%\" and industry data such as \"90.7% retention rate\" for advisor tenure. The report shows strong causal reasoning, explaining how \"trading revenue drives record-setting quarter\" and linking wealth management growth to \"asset price appreciation and shift to fee-based assets.\" However, while the report mentions potential scenarios like regulatory impacts and market corrections, it lacks comprehensive quantified sensitivity analysis or multiple detailed scenarios that would elevate it to excellent.",
