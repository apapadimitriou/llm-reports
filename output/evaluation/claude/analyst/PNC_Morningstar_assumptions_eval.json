    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides several explicit key assumptions with specific numerical targets and timeframes. Major drivers include NII growth of 7% in 2025, efficiency ratio declining to 58%, normalized charge-off ratio of 0.47%, cost of equity at 9%, and normalized ROTE of 16.5%. These assumptions are clearly stated and proximal to forecasts with solid justification through historical context, peer comparisons, and BBVA acquisition analysis. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers. While qualitative risks are mentioned (tariff uncertainty, interest rate cycles, credit cycles), no numerical ranges or stress scenarios are provided for key variables like NII, efficiency ratios, or credit costs. This absence of robust sensitivity analysis caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise solid assumption quality and internal consistency.",
