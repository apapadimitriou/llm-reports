    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms throughout. The analysis provides explicit causal explanations such as \"NII improved... driven by lower deposit costs and fixed-rate asset repricing\" and \"efficiency ratio eventually declines to about 58%\" with specific drivers. Key assumptions are quantified and benchmarked, including \"normalized return on tangible common equity of roughly 16.5%\" versus \"cost of equity at 9%\" and \"net charge-off ratio normalizing to 0.47% through the cycle.\" The report includes some counterpoint analysis through \"Bears Say\" sections and risk discussions, noting \"tariff-related uncertainties\" and potential economic slowdowns. However, while assumptions are well-supported and benchmarked against historical performance and peer comparisons, the report lacks comprehensive quantified scenario analysis or sensitivity testing that would demonstrate how key variables might impact valuations under different conditions.",
