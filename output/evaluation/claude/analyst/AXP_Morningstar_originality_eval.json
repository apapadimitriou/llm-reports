    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong originality through multiple substantive syntheses and unique perspectives on American Express. Key original insights include: (1) The quantified synthesis linking stress test results to potential capital returns (estimating 5% of market cap could be returned), (2) The strategic shift analysis connecting younger demographics + lending features to a specific 26.1% CAGR in net interest income from 2021-2024, with clear deceleration expectations, (3) The unique closed-loop network advantage thesis explaining how AXP captures full economic profit from payments unlike competitors, and (4) The commercial card switching costs mechanism tied to large credit lines and monthly payment requirements. The report provides company-specific analysis with quantified drivers (average spending per card of $24,600, specific growth rates, margin projections) and clear catalysts. While some sections contain standard moat descriptions, the core insights are decision-relevant and distinct to American Express rather than generic to the sector.",
