    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates partial explicitness with key assumptions stated but scattered throughout sections. Justification is weak to partial - growth assumptions like \"6% organic growth\" and \"52% operating margin by 2029\" lack supporting evidence or peer benchmarks. Specificity is partial with some time horizons (5-year outlook to 2029) and units provided, but causal drivers are often vague. Internal consistency appears clean with no obvious contradictions between narrative and financial tables. However, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like ratings revenue volatility, margin assumptions, or valuation parameters. The DCF model shows key inputs (WACC 7.3%, terminal growth assumptions) but without justification or stress testing. While assumptions are more explicit than typical poor-rated reports, the absence of any quantified sensitivities caps the grade at Fair per the methodology.",
