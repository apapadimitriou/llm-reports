    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Morgan Stanley equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language, logical structure, and mostly smooth transitions between sections. The report flows well from the analyst note discussing stress test results to strategic outlook, bulls/bears analysis, and valuation sections. The narrative consistently reinforces Morgan Stanley's shift toward wealth management and the benefits of this strategic transformation. Key terms like 'narrow moat,' 'stress capital buffers,' and financial metrics are used consistently throughout. The Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case narrative, acknowledging both the company's strategic advantages and concerns about overvaluation. Financial projections in the valuation tables support the narrative assumptions about revenue growth and margin expansion. While there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother, such as between some subsections in the Economic Moat discussion, these don't materially detract from the overall coherence. The temporal references are accurate, with recent stress test results properly dated to June 27, 2025, and analyst notes appropriately sequenced. The report successfully presents a unified investment thesis despite covering multiple complex business segments.",
