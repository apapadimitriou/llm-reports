    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Johnson & Johnson equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across most essential sections. The report includes all major components: comprehensive analyst notes, detailed business description, strategic outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with profit drivers, risk analysis, capital allocation evaluation, and extensive financial snapshots with multi-year forecasts. The financial data includes sector-appropriate pharmaceutical KPIs like R&D spending ratios, operating margins, and return metrics. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (new drug launches, patent losses) to fair value assumptions through detailed DCF modeling. Peer benchmarking is present with comparative analysis of competitors. The report demonstrates consistent evidence integration with dated analyst notes and proper sourcing. However, the report lacks formal scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base-case DCF model, which prevents an excellent rating. The content is well-proportioned with appropriate depth across sections and minimal redundancy.",
