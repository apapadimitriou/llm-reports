    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic banking analysis. Key original insights include linking JPMorgan's tech budget advantage ($15B annually, 50% higher than closest competitor) to competitive moat strengthening, synthesizing deposit market share gains (11.3% vs 7.5% in 2013) with cost advantages and switching costs, and connecting the First Republic acquisition to wealth management franchise enhancement. The analyst provides quantified mechanisms like projecting 18.5% midcycle ROTE vs management's 17% guidance, and links rate path expectations to NII trajectory with specific forecasts. The valuation incorporates novel drivers beyond standard DCF, including tech investment payoffs and market share expansion effects. While some generic banking themes appear, the report's company-specific analysis, quantified projections, and unique competitive positioning arguments demonstrate clear decision relevance and actionable insights.",
