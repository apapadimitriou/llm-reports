    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic pharma analysis. The analyst provides quantified insights linking policy risks to specific revenue impacts (24% US revenue hit from European price alignment), connects Stelara biosimilar competition to concrete growth trajectories for replacement drugs like Tremfya (>$5B peak sales by 2028), and offers detailed acquisition analysis with specific value creation mechanisms. The tariff impact analysis synthesizes manufacturing exposure with margin implications (2 percentage point headwind). While some sections contain standard pharma themes, the report consistently adds J&J-specific angles with numerical forecasts, timelines, and catalysts that make insights actionable and decision-relevant.",
