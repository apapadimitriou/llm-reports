    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms, explicit assumptions, and quantified forecasts. The analysis provides excellent causal explanations such as \"NII was $14.6B, driven by higher yielding assets\" and \"stress capital buffers decline by about 40 basis points on average.\" Key assumptions are explicit and benchmarked, including \"9.5% cost of equity,\" \"midcycle ROTE of around 14%,\" and \"2.5% expense compounded annual growth rate.\" The report quantifies specific projections like \"NII to grow by around 6.8% in 2025\" and \"efficiency ratio to improve to high-50s.\" However, while the report mentions some counterpoints in the Bears Say section about rate cuts and economic slowdowns, it lacks comprehensive scenario analysis with quantified sensitivity ranges. The implications are actionable, noting the bank is \"overvalued\" at current prices and providing specific investment guidance. The analysis falls short of \"Excellent\" due to limited quantified scenario modeling, though it provides solid fundamental analysis with clear mechanisms linking assumptions to valuation.",
