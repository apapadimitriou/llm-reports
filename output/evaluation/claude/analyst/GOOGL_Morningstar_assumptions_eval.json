{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates good explicitness with key assumptions clearly stated throughout the narrative, including revenue growth rates, margin expectations, and capital expenditure guidance. Justification is solid, drawing on historical performance, peer comparisons, and market context. Specificity is strong with clear units, timeframes, and drivers provided (e.g., 10% revenue CAGR, Google Cloud growing 26% annually, operating margins staying flat at 32%). Internal consistency is maintained across narrative and financial tables. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers beyond qualitative bear/bull cases mentioned in passing. While growth rates and margin assumptions are well-supported, there are no stress-tests showing valuation impact ranges for key variables like search growth rates, cloud adoption, or regulatory outcomes. This absence of robust quantified sensitivities caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise strong assumption quality.",
