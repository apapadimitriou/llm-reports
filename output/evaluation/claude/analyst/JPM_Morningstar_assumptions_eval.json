    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong explicitness with key assumptions clearly stated near relevant forecasts, including specific metrics like 18.5% midcycle ROTE, 13.5% CET1 ratio, 2.61% NIM for 2025, 5% loan growth projections, and 52% efficiency ratio targets. Justification is solid, with assumptions supported by management guidance (17% ROTE target), peer comparisons, and multi-year historical context. Specificity is comprehensive with precise units, timeframes, and causal drivers throughout. Internal consistency is maintained across narrative and financial tables with no contradictions identified. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like interest rates, credit costs, or loan growth, which caps the grade at Good despite otherwise excellent assumption quality.",
