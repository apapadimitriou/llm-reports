    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Medtronic equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and well-structured sections that reinforce each other effectively. The narrative flows logically from business strategy through valuation, with explicit cross-references between sections. For example, the Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case growth assumptions in Fair Value, and the Economic Moat discussion directly supports the valuation methodology. The report maintains consistent terminology throughout and provides smooth transitions between topics. Financial projections in the tables align with narrative assumptions about 4% revenue growth and margin expansion. The temporal claims are accurate relative to the report dates, and the extensive analyst notes archive demonstrates consistent messaging over time. While there are minor areas where transitions could be slightly smoother, such as between some subsections in the Economic Moat discussion, these do not materially detract from the report's coherence. The comprehensive coverage of risks, competitive positioning, and ESG factors creates a well-rounded analytical framework that reads as one connected argument rather than isolated sections.",
    "evidence": [
        "Bulls/Bears section explicitly aligns with valuation assumptions - 'mid-single-digit top-line growth' mentioned in both sections consistently",
        "Economic Moat section directly supports narrow moat rating with detailed switching costs and intangible assets analysis that connects to competitive advantages",
        "Financial tables show consistent 4% revenue growth matching narrative assumptions about renal denervation and pulsed field ablation adoption"
