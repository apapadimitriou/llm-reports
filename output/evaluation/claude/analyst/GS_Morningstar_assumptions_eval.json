{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report explicitly states several key assumptions but provides limited justification and no quantified sensitivity analysis. Assumptions are moderately specific with clear units and time horizons, including 9.5% cost of equity, 3.5% annual revenue growth, and specific efficiency ratio targets. However, justification relies heavily on management targets rather than independent analysis or peer benchmarks. The report shows good internal consistency between narrative and tables. The critical weakness is the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers like cost of equity, growth rates, or margin assumptions, which caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise solid assumption disclosure.",
