    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides reasonably explicit assumptions with some justification. Key drivers like revenue growth (17% CAGR through 2029), gross margins (62%-64% range), and operating margins (mid-40% range) are clearly stated with specific targets and timeframes. The WACC of 9% and terminal growth assumptions are present in the valuation section. However, justification relies heavily on qualitative assessments rather than detailed peer comparisons or historical benchmarks. The specificity is solid with clear units and horizons for most assumptions. Internal consistency appears clean with no obvious contradictions between narrative and financial tables. The critical weakness is the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise reasonable assumption quality.",
