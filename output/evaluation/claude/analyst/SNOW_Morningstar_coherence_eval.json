    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Snowflake equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language and mostly smooth transitions throughout its sections. The narrative flows logically from the recent earnings announcement through business strategy, valuation methodology, and risk assessment. Key terms like 'data lake,' 'data warehouse,' and 'RPO' are used consistently, and the analyst effectively connects sections by referencing how strong AI sales and product launches support the raised fair value estimate. The Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case narrative around AI monetization and competitive pressures. Financial projections in the tables are consistent with the narrative expectations of 23% revenue CAGR and improving margins. The temporal references are accurate, with recent earnings properly dated to Q4 fiscal 2025. While there are minor rough edges in some transitions between subsections and the Economic Moat section could better integrate with the valuation discussion, the overall argument is cohesive and internally consistent. The extensive analyst notes archive provides helpful context for the current assessment changes.",
    "evidence": [
        "Strong cross-referencing: 'Therefore, we have raised our intermediate revenue growth and profitability estimates... As a result, we are raising our fair value estimate to $165 per share from $129' (Analyst Note)",
        "Consistent terminology and data alignment: RPO growth of 33% year-over-year mentioned in narrative matches the financial performance discussion throughout",
        "Bulls/Bears reconciled with base case: AI uncertainty in Bears section directly addresses the AI-driven growth assumptions underlying the raised valuation"
