    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across most essential sections for equity research. It includes all major content areas: Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears analysis, Economic Moat assessment, Fair Value with explicit DCF methodology, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, and extensive Financials with multi-year forecasts. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (AUM growth, fee rates, margin expansion) to fair value through detailed DCF modeling. Asset management sector-specific KPIs are well-covered including AUM levels, organic growth rates, fee realization rates, and operating margins. Peer comparison is present with detailed competitor analysis. However, the report lacks scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond bull/bear cases and could benefit from more explicit stress testing of key assumptions.",
