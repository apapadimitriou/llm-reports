    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides some key assumptions but with significant weaknesses. Revenue growth assumptions are stated (5-year CAGR ~13%) with qualitative drivers identified (Azure, Office 365, AI adoption), showing partial explicitness and specificity. Operating margin projections (45% to 46% by 2029) are provided with basic justification around Azure scaling and operating leverage. However, critical valuation inputs lack proper support: the 8.8% WACC is stated without derivation or market context, and the 9.4% Stage II growth rate appears arbitrary. While the DCF methodology is comprehensive, no sensitivity analysis or scenario testing is provided for any material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair. The assumptions that are stated generally align with the financial tables, showing reasonable internal consistency.",
