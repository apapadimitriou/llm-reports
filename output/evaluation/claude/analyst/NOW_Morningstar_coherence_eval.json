    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This ServiceNow equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language, logical section flow, and consistent terminology usage. The analyst note provides a compelling narrative arc from Q2 earnings results to fair value revision, with explicit connections between performance metrics and valuation adjustments. Cross-references between sections work well, particularly linking the moat analysis to retention metrics and the valuation section to growth assumptions. The business strategy section smoothly transitions from historical land-and-expand success to future AI-driven growth prospects. Financial tables align consistently with narrative claims about revenue growth, margin expansion, and profitability targets. Temporal references are accurate throughout, with proper dating of recent earnings and guidance updates. The Bulls/Bears section appropriately balances growth opportunities against competitive and execution risks, though the reconciliation with the base-case valuation could be more explicit. Minor rough edges include some dense technical passages in the moat section and limited direct cross-referencing between the detailed financial projections and strategic assumptions, but these don't materially detract from the report's overall coherence and readability.",
