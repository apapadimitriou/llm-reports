    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates comprehensive coverage of all major sections expected for equity research with substantial depth and sector-appropriate detail. The analyst provides thorough analysis across business description, competitive positioning, valuation methodology, risk assessment, and capital allocation. The financials snapshot includes extensive multi-year forecasts with relevant CRO industry metrics like backlog, book-to-bill ratios, and segment-specific KPIs. Valuation assumptions are explicitly linked to operating drivers including margin expansion from AI investments and outsourcing trends. Sources appear consistently cited throughout. While peer benchmarking is present via competitor comparison tables, the report lacks explicit scenario analysis or sensitivity testing around key assumptions, preventing an Excellent rating. The comprehensive analyst notes archive and detailed DCF methodology demonstrate exceptional thoroughness in most areas.",
