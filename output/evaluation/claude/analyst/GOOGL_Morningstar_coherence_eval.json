    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Alphabet equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language, smooth transitions between sections, and well-integrated analysis. The narrative flows logically from the analyst note discussing Apple's potential Safari changes through strategic outlook, moat analysis, valuation, and risks. Key terms like 'economic moat,' 'RSA' (revenue sharing agreement), and 'GCP' are consistently defined and used throughout. The report effectively cross-references sections, with the Bulls/Bears arguments aligning well with the base-case valuation narrative that acknowledges both growth opportunities (cloud, AI) and risks (antitrust, competition). Financial projections in the valuation model tables are consistent with the narrative discussion of Google Cloud's 26% annual growth expectations and overall 10% CAGR. The temporal claims appear accurate, with recent events like Eddy Cue's May 7 testimony properly contextualized. While there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother, particularly between some subsections in the Economic Moat analysis, the overall structure is coherent and the assumptions align well across narrative and quantitative sections.",
