    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal explanations and explicit, quantified assumptions. The analyst provides strong causal reasoning throughout, such as \"NII was driven by higher yielding assets\" and explains that \"stress capital buffers decline by about 40 basis points\" due to Fed policy changes. Key assumptions are explicitly stated and benchmarked, including \"cost of equity of 10%,\" \"midcycle return on tangible equity of around 8%,\" and \"efficiency ratio of less than 60%.\" The report quantifies forecasts with specific targets like \"NII growing modestly by 0.8% in 2025\" and \"overall revenue growth of around 2%-3% annually.\" However, while the report mentions some sensitivity analysis (\"If Fed cuts rates, NIM could compress\"), it lacks comprehensive scenario analysis with multiple quantified outcomes. The implications are actionable, noting that \"Getting through consent orders\" and \"progress on expense savings\" could be catalysts, but the scenario analysis could be more extensive to reach the Excellent grade.",
