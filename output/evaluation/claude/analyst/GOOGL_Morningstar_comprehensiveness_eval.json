    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major sections expected for equity research. It includes thorough analyst notes, business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears analysis, detailed economic moat assessment, fair value analysis with explicit DCF methodology, risk evaluation, capital allocation assessment, and extensive financial forecasts. The report provides tech sector-appropriate coverage including revenue growth rates, cloud metrics, advertising performance, and competitive positioning against major peers (Amazon, Apple, Microsoft). The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (search growth at 6% CAGR, cloud growth at 26% CAGR) to the $237 fair value estimate through detailed DCF modeling. While the report lacks explicit scenario analysis tables and formal sensitivity analysis, it does present bear case ($175) and bull case ($266) valuations, demonstrating consideration of alternative outcomes. The extensive peer comparison and sum-of-the-parts analysis add analytical depth.",
