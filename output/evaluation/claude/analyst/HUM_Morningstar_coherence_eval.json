    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Morningstar equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and logical flow between sections. The analyst effectively connects the June 16, 2025 analyst day event to both near-term challenges and long-term opportunities, maintaining consistent terminology throughout (MA for Medicare Advantage, fair value estimates, etc.). The narrative smoothly transitions from current challenges to management's bull-case scenario, with explicit cross-references between valuation assumptions and risk factors. The Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case narrative, acknowledging both demographic tailwinds and regulatory headwinds. Financial tables support the narrative projections, showing expected margin recovery through 2029. Temporal references are accurate, consistently referencing the June 2025 analyst day as recent. Minor areas for improvement include some dense transitions in the Economic Moat section and occasional technical jargon that could benefit from clearer explanation, but these don't materially detract from the report's overall coherence.",
