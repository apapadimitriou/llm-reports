    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Broadcom equity research report covers all major sections expected for semiconductor industry analysis. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit DCF methodology, risk analysis, and capital allocation review. The financials snapshot provides extensive multi-year data with semiconductor-appropriate KPIs including revenue growth, operating margins, EBITDA margins, and ROIC. Peer benchmarking is present with detailed competitor analysis. The valuation section clearly links AI chip growth drivers to fair value calculations. Evidence citations are consistent throughout with proper sourcing. While the report demonstrates strong coverage across all expected areas with sector-specific depth, it lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the standard DCF model, preventing an 'Excellent' rating.",
