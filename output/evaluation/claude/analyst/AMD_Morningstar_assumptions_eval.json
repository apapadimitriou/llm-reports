    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid assumption quality with explicit key drivers and reasonable justification. Revenue growth assumptions are clearly stated (17% CAGR 2025-2029, 33% growth in 2025) with specific segment breakdowns. AI GPU revenue projections ($8.2B in 2025, $17.9B in 2029) are explicitly linked to the China policy reversal. Margin expansion targets (57% gross margin by 2027, 35% operating margin by 2029) align with management guidance. WACC assumptions (9%) and share count (flat at 1,637M) are transparent. The DCF model provides comprehensive valuation drivers including cost of equity, terminal growth assumptions, and stage-based forecasting. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers like AI market size, competitive dynamics, or margin assumptions, which prevents an Excellent rating despite otherwise strong assumption disclosure.",
