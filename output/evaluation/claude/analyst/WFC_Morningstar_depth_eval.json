    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal reasoning throughout. Causal mechanisms are well-articulated, such as \"NIM compression and modest growth in loan and deposit balances lead to a NII growth of about 1% in 2025\" and \"Lower interest rates result in NIM of 2.66% in 2026.\" Explicit assumptions are quantified and benchmarked, including \"cost of equity of around 9.0%\" versus \"terminal return on tangible equity of roughly 14.3%\" and \"NIM to compress slightly to around 2.70% in 2025 from 2.74% in 2024.\" The report provides some scenario analysis with \"federal-funds rate to reach 2.50% by the end of 2027\" and discusses rate sensitivity impacts. However, it lacks comprehensive quantified sensitivity ranges or multiple detailed scenarios that would elevate it to excellent. The implications are actionable, linking asset cap removal to improved efficiency and growth prospects. While the analysis is thorough with solid benchmarking against cost of capital and peer metrics, the scenario analysis could be more extensive to achieve the highest grade.",
