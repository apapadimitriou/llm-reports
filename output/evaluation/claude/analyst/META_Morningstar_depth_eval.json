    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms throughout. The analyst provides strong causal explanations such as \"ad loads quite high on saturated products\" explaining Meta's need for new ad inventory, and \"average revenue per user growing an impressive 16%\" tied to AI-driven ad targeting improvements. The report contains explicit, quantified assumptions including \"12% compound annual growth rate for the next five years,\" \"operating margins rising to 43%,\" and detailed DCF inputs like \"WACC 8.9%\" and \"Stage II EBI Growth Rate 8.9%.\" These assumptions are benchmarked against historical performance and industry context. The analysis shows some counterpoint consideration with \"Bears Say\" sections and regulatory risks, plus conditional scenarios like \"if ByteDance does not come to agreement...resulting in additional 20% fair value increase.\" However, the report lacks comprehensive sensitivity analysis or multiple quantified scenarios around key assumptions, preventing an Excellent rating despite strong foundational analysis.",
