    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Biogen equity research report demonstrates clear language and mostly smooth transitions throughout its sections. The narrative flows logically from the company's strategic overview through detailed analysis of its MS franchise decline, emerging drug portfolio, and valuation methodology. Key sections reinforce each other effectively - the Bulls/Bears points align well with the base-case assumptions, and the Economic Moat discussion connects appropriately to the Fair Value analysis. The analyst consistently uses terminology and maintains temporal accuracy throughout. The report successfully addresses potential contradictions, such as explaining how declining MS revenues are offset by new drug launches and Roche royalties. Financial tables align with narrative claims about revenue trends and margin improvements. While there are minor rough edges in some transitions between subsections, the overall coherence is strong with explicit cross-references between assumptions, risks, and valuation drivers.",
    "evidence": [
        "Clear cross-referencing between sections, e.g., 'We see Biogen as a firm in transition, as MS revenue fades and new drugs for Alzheimer's, depression, and rare diseases begin to ramp up' connects strategy to valuation assumptions",
        "Bulls/Bears section properly reconciled with base case - Bears note 'MS portfolio under pressure' while Bulls highlight 'neurology portfolio outside of MS should help diversify revenue,' both reflected in declining MS forecasts offset by new drug growth",
        "Financial tables align with narrative claims - revenue decline from 'nearly 10% annually' for MS drugs matches the forecasted revenue trends in the valuation model"
