    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Amazon equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language, logical structure, and mostly smooth transitions between sections. The narrative flows well from the strategic overview through moat analysis to valuation, with sections reinforcing each other effectively. Key terms like 'wide moat,' 'AWS,' and 'Prime' are used consistently throughout. The Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case narrative, highlighting growth drivers (AWS, advertising) and acknowledging risks (regulatory concerns, international expansion challenges). Financial projections in the valuation tables are consistent with the narrative assumptions about margin expansion and growth rates. Temporal references are accurate, with recent earnings notes properly dated. The report successfully weaves together Amazon's retail, cloud, and advertising businesses into a cohesive investment thesis. Minor areas for improvement include some transitions that could be more explicit and occasional dense paragraphs in the moat section, but these don't significantly detract from the overall coherent argument.",
    "evidence": [
        "Bulls/Bears section directly supports base-case narrative: 'High-margin advertising and AWS are growing faster than the corporate average' aligns with valuation assumptions of 16-17% CAGR growth",
        "Financial tables consistent with narrative: projected operating margin expansion from 11% to 13% supports the 'margins continue to expand' thesis in Strategy section",
        "Clear cross-references between sections: Economic Moat section's discussion of Prime's 'switching costs' connects to Strategy section's emphasis on Prime as key differentiator"
