    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Apple equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and solid structural connections. The narrative flows logically from recent WWDC developments through strategic analysis, moat assessment, and valuation details. Sections effectively cross-reference each other, particularly between the moat analysis and business strategy sections, which both emphasize Apple's ecosystem integration and switching costs. The Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case narrative, acknowledging both ecosystem strengths and geopolitical risks. Financial tables are consistent with the narrative forecasts, showing projected revenue growth and margin expansion that support the analytical discussion. Temporal references are accurate throughout, with recent events like the June 2025 WWDC properly contextualized. The terminology is used consistently, and the $200 fair value estimate is well-supported by the DCF analysis. While some transitions between subsections could be slightly smoother, the report maintains strong internal consistency without material contradictions.",
    "evidence": [
        "Strong cross-referencing between sections: 'We believe Apple has solidified its long-term position' in Strategy connects directly to the detailed moat analysis of switching costs and ecosystem integration",
        "Bulls/Bears align with base case: Bears acknowledge 'geopolitical supply chain and tariff risk' which matches the analyst's expectation of 'adequately priced' risks in the conclusion",
        "Financial forecasts consistent with narrative: 7% compound annual revenue growth projection matches the detailed product-by-product growth expectations outlined in the Fair Value section"
