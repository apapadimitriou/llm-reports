    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates partial explicitness with key assumptions stated but scattered throughout. Revenue growth projections (6% CAGR over five years) and margin improvement expectations (20 basis points annually) are explicitly mentioned with specific timeframes. Cost of equity (9%) is clearly stated. However, justification is weak - growth assumptions lack peer benchmarks or detailed historical analysis beyond general commentary. Specificity is partial with some units and horizons provided but limited detail on causal drivers. Internal consistency appears clean with no obvious contradictions between narrative and financial tables. The critical weakness is the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite other positive elements.",
