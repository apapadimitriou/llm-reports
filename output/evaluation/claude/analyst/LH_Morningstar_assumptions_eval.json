    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates partial explicitness with key assumptions like revenue growth (3.4% through 2028) and operating margin improvement (500 basis points by 2028) clearly stated. Justification is weak to partial - while revenue growth references medical utilization trends and acquisitions, specific supporting data is limited. The WACC of 8.0% and cost of equity of 9.0% lack proper sourcing or derivation details. Specificity is solid with clear units, timeframes, and drivers provided for most assumptions. Internal consistency appears clean with no major contradictions identified between narrative and financial tables. However, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite other reasonable qualities.",
