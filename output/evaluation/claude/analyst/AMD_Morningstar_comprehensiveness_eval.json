    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This AMD equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across all major sections expected for semiconductor analysis. The report includes thorough coverage of business description, competitive positioning, economic moat analysis, valuation methodology with explicit DCF modeling, risk assessment, and capital allocation. The financials snapshot provides multi-year historical and forecast data with appropriate semiconductor KPIs including revenue growth, operating margins, ROIC, and segment-specific metrics for data center, client, gaming, and embedded businesses. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (AI GPU growth, market share gains, margin expansion) to fair value assumptions through detailed DCF analysis. Peer benchmarking with Intel and Nvidia is present with comparative metrics. The report maintains consistent sourcing and minimal redundancy. While scenario analysis is not explicitly present as a separate section, sensitivity considerations are embedded throughout the risk and valuation discussions.",
