    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Medtronic equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across most expected sections. It includes all major content areas: executive summary, business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with profit drivers, risk analysis, capital allocation, detailed financials, ESG coverage, and competitive analysis. The report provides appropriate medical device sector KPIs including revenue growth, operating margins, ROIC, and product-specific metrics. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (new product adoption, margin expansion) to the $112 fair value estimate through a detailed DCF model. Evidence is consistently cited with analyst notes and financial data. However, the report lacks formal scenario analysis or sensitivity testing around key assumptions, which prevents an 'Excellent' rating despite the otherwise thorough coverage.",
