    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Apple equity research report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major sections expected for professional equity analysis. The report includes thorough analyst notes, detailed business description, strategic outlook, bulls/bears analysis, extensive economic moat discussion, explicit valuation methodology, risk assessment, capital allocation analysis, and robust financial projections with sector-appropriate KPIs. The valuation section effectively links operating drivers (iPhone growth, services expansion, margin improvements) to the $200 fair value estimate through detailed DCF modeling. Competitive positioning is well-addressed with peer comparisons to Alphabet, Microsoft, and Samsung. The report maintains consistent sourcing throughout and avoids significant redundancy. While it lacks explicit scenario analysis and sensitivity testing that would elevate it to excellent, the depth of analysis, clear linkage between fundamentals and valuation, and comprehensive treatment of all key areas merits a strong good rating.",
