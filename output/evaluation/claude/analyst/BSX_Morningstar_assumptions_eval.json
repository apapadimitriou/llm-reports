{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates reasonable explicitness with key assumptions clearly stated in the valuation section, including WACC (8.6%), cost of equity (9.0%), long-run tax rate (19.0%), and Stage II growth rates. Justification is partial, with some assumptions supported by historical context and industry dynamics, but lacking comprehensive peer benchmarks or detailed sourcing. Specificity is solid with clear units, timeframes, and magnitudes provided for most drivers. However, the report is capped at Fair due to the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material valuation drivers, despite the analyst's acknowledgment of various risks and uncertainties that could impact outcomes.",
