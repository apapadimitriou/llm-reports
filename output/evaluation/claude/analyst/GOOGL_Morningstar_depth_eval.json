    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms, explicit assumptions, and quantified benchmarks. The analyst provides excellent causal reasoning throughout, explaining that \"Google Search growing at 6%\" versus \"digital advertising market at 10%\" is driven by \"AI-infused search engines and fewer ads.\" Multiple explicit assumptions are well-benchmarked, including \"WACC ~9%\", \"Google Cloud sales to grow 26% annually\", and \"Google Cloud to constitute around 25%\" of revenue by 2029. The valuation methodology is comprehensive with detailed DCF modeling and sum-of-parts analysis. However, the report falls short of 'Excellent' due to limited quantified scenario analysis. While bull and bear cases are presented (\"bear case fair value $175\" vs \"bull case $266\"), these scenarios lack extensive sensitivity ranges or detailed stress-testing of key assumptions. The actionable implications are strong, providing clear investment guidance with specific price targets and risk assessments.",
