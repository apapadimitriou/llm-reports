    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This CrowdStrike equity research report demonstrates strong structural coherence and clear narrative flow throughout its sections. The analyst effectively connects the July 19 outage impact across multiple sections, showing how it affects current margins while expressing confidence in recovery. The Business Strategy section smoothly transitions into the Economic Moat discussion, both reinforcing the land-and-expand strategy and switching costs themes. The Fair Value section appropriately references the 22% revenue CAGR assumption and connects to the margin expansion narrative discussed earlier. Terminology is used consistently throughout, with proper application of technical terms like ARR, EDR, and ROIC. The financial tables align well with the narrative assumptions about revenue growth and margin recovery. The Bulls/Bears section appropriately balances the growth opportunity narrative with competitive risks. While there are minor areas where transitions could be slightly smoother, the report reads as a cohesive analytical piece rather than disconnected sections, with explicit cross-references and logical progression from analysis to valuation conclusion.",
