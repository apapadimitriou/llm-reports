    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Citigroup equity research report demonstrates strong structural coherence with clear language and well-organized sections that flow logically from the analyst note through business strategy, economic moat analysis, valuation, and risks. The report maintains consistent terminology throughout and effectively cross-references key themes across sections. The analyst note on stress test results connects well to the broader valuation discussion, and the business strategy section provides clear context for the economic moat analysis. The Bulls/Bears section aligns reasonably well with the base-case narrative, acknowledging both the potential for structural improvement and the historical underperformance challenges. The extensive economic moat section provides detailed analysis that supports the no-moat rating and connects to valuation assumptions. Financial projections in the valuation model appear consistent with the narrative discussion of modest NII growth and expense control initiatives. The report includes appropriate citations and temporal references that align with the dates provided. While there are some minor rough edges in transitions between subsections and the report is quite lengthy, the overall coherence is strong with no material contradictions identified.",
