{
    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates good quality assumptions across most pillars. Key assumptions are explicitly stated and proximal to forecasts, including specific growth rates, margins, and time horizons. The analyst provides solid justification through historical context (26.1% NII CAGR 2021-24) and peer comparisons. Specificity is strong with detailed units, percentages, and timeframes throughout. Internal consistency is maintained between narrative and financial tables. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like discount revenue growth, NII projections, or credit costs, which prevents an Excellent rating despite otherwise comprehensive assumption quality.",
