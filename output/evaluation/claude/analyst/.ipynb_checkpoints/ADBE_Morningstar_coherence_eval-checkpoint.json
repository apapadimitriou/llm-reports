    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Adobe equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and well-structured sections that reinforce each other. The narrative flows logically from recent earnings results through strategic analysis to valuation, with explicit connections between sections. The analyst effectively links AI monetization progress ($160M ARR growing to $250M) across multiple sections, and the Bulls/Bears cases align well with the base-case narrative around AI adoption and market positioning. Financial projections in the valuation tables are consistent with the narrative assumptions about 10% revenue CAGR and margin expansion. The report maintains consistent terminology throughout and provides smooth transitions between topics. While there are minor areas where connections could be more explicit, the report reads as a cohesive investment argument with no material contradictions between assumptions, tables, and narrative content.",

        "Strong cross-referencing: AI revenue figures ($160M ARR, targeting $250M) mentioned consistently in Analyst Note and referenced throughout strategic sections",
        "Bulls/Bears cases well-reconciled with base case: Bulls emphasize subscription model strength and market dominance, which aligns with analyst's 10% growth assumptions and wide moat rating",
        "Financial tables align with narrative: 10% revenue CAGR projection matches analyst's 'approximately 10%' growth forecast in Fair Value section"
