    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid originality through multiple company-specific syntheses and analyses. Key strengths include: (1) Detailed analysis of AbbVie's transition from Humira dependence to next-generation immunology drugs (Skyrizi/Rinvoq), with specific growth projections and timelines; (2) Quantified policy risk assessment linking Trump's executive order to potential 24% US revenue hit and 10% Medicare hospital exposure; (3) Company-specific valuation drivers including IL23/JAK pathway advantages and Allergan acquisition synergies; (4) Pipeline-specific insights on TL1A, alpha-4 beta-7 combinations and ABBV-295 obesity drug with concrete 2026 data expectations. While some sections contain standard industry commentary, the report provides substantial decision-relevant analysis with specific mechanisms, catalysts, and quantified outcomes that go well beyond generic pharmaceutical industry observations.",
