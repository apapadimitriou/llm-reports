    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This AbbVie equity research report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major sections expected for biopharma analysis. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit DCF modeling, risk analysis, and capital allocation review. The financials snapshot provides extensive multi-year data with sector-appropriate metrics including revenue growth, operating margins, R&D spending ratios, and pipeline-specific KPIs. The valuation section effectively links operating drivers (Skyrizi/Rinvoq growth, Humira decline, pipeline development) to fair value assumptions through detailed DCF methodology. Peer benchmarking is present with competitive analysis against Eli Lilly, J&J, and Merck. Evidence citations are consistent throughout with specific dates and sources. The report demonstrates minimal redundancy and maintains proportional depth across sections, though it lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the DCF framework.",
