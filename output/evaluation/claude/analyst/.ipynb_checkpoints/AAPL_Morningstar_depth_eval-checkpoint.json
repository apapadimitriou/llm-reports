    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms and explicit, benchmarked assumptions throughout. The analyst provides strong causal explanations like \"iPhone revenue declining 1% year over year\" tied to specific drivers, and \"we project 7% compound annual revenue growth\" with detailed segment breakdowns. Key assumptions are well-quantified and benchmarked: \"WACC ~8.9%, terminal growth ~2.5%\" and \"gross margins to rise to 49% in fiscal 2029.\" The report includes some scenario considerations like \"25% gross downside risk to earnings\" from tariff exposure and acknowledges counterpoints such as \"China remained a growth headwind.\" However, while assumptions are explicit and some sensitivity is provided, the report lacks comprehensive quantified scenario analysis across multiple variables. The implications are actionable with clear investment thesis around ecosystem moat and fair valuation assessment.",
