    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates partial explicitness with key valuation assumptions stated in the DCF section, including cost of equity (7.5%), WACC (7.0%), and terminal growth (5.0%). However, justification is weak - these parameters lack supporting evidence from peer comparisons or market data. Specificity is solid with clear units and timeframes for financial projections through 2029. Internal consistency appears clean with no contradictions identified between narrative and financial tables. The critical limitation is the complete absence of sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers, despite the report's 'High' uncertainty rating and significant business risks (Humira patent cliff, regulatory threats). While revenue growth assumptions and margin expectations are discussed qualitatively, no quantified ranges or stress tests are provided for key variables like drug pricing pressures, competitive dynamics, or cost structure changes. This lack of sensitivity analysis, combined with weak parameter justification, caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise reasonable assumption transparency.",
