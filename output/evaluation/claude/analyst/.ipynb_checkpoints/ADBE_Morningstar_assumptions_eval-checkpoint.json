{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid explicitness with key assumptions clearly stated in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section. Revenue growth assumptions (10% five-year CAGR) and margin expansion guidance are specific with clear time horizons. Justification is partial, referencing management guidance and historical performance patterns, but lacks deep peer comparisons or external sources. The DCF model shows comprehensive specificity with detailed WACC components (9.0% cost of equity, 8.8% WACC), investment rates (30.0%), and stage-specific growth assumptions. Internal consistency appears clean with no obvious contradictions between narrative and financial tables. However, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like revenue growth, margins, or WACC, which caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise solid assumption quality.",
