    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This AbbVie equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language and well-structured sections that reinforce each other effectively. The narrative flows logically from the executive order analysis through business strategy, valuation drivers, and risk assessment. The analyst consistently maintains terminology throughout, properly distinguishing between different drug classes and regulatory pathways. Financial tables align well with the narrative assumptions, showing projected growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq offsetting Humira declines as described in the text. The Bulls/Bears section appropriately balances the base-case valuation narrative, acknowledging both the strong dividend support and aesthetic business entrenchment alongside legitimate concerns about acquisition dependence and Humira margin compression. Cross-references between sections work well, with the Economic Moat section supporting the Fair Value analysis and Risk sections appropriately flagging policy uncertainties. The temporal accuracy is maintained throughout, with recent events like Trump's May 12 executive order properly contextualized. While there are minor rough edges in some transitions between subsections, the overall analytical framework holds together cohesively.",
    "evidence": [
        "Strong cross-referencing between sections, such as Fair Value section explicitly building on 'next-generation immunology drugs targeting the IL23 and JAK pathways' mentioned in Business Strategy",
        "Financial projections align with narrative, showing Skyrizi/Rinvoq combined growth from $17.7B to $31B by 2027 supporting the Humira transition story",
        "Bulls/Bears appropriately balanced with base case, acknowledging both 'strong dividend yield' support and 'high profit margins on Humira' amplifying biosimilar impact"
