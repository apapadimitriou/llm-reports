    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive PNC Financial Services report covers all major sections expected for equity research with good depth and sector-appropriate analysis. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit profit drivers, risk analysis, and capital allocation discussion. The financials snapshot provides multi-year forecasts with banking-specific KPIs including NIM, efficiency ratios, ROE, ROTE, and provision ratios. Peer benchmarking is present through competitor comparison tables. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (NII growth, fee income, expense control, credit costs) to the $181 fair value estimate. Evidence citations are consistent throughout with proper sourcing. While comprehensive, the report lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case assumptions, preventing an excellent rating.",
