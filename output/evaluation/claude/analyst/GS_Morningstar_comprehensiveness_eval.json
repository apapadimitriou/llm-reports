    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Goldman Sachs equity research report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major sections expected for investment banking analysis. The report includes detailed analyst notes, thorough business strategy analysis, extensive economic moat discussion, explicit valuation methodology with clear driver linkages, comprehensive risk assessment, capital allocation analysis, and robust financials with appropriate banking sector KPIs including ROE, ROA, efficiency ratios, CET1, and NIM. The competitive positioning section provides meaningful peer comparisons with JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America. ESG considerations are appropriately integrated. The valuation section explicitly connects operating drivers to fair value through detailed DCF methodology. While the report lacks formal scenario analysis and stress testing beyond regulatory results, the depth of analysis, sector-appropriate metrics, consistent evidence integration, and clear linkage between business drivers and valuation assumptions demonstrate strong comprehensiveness for investment banking coverage.",
