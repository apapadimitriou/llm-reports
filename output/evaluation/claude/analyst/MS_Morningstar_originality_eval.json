    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic banking analysis. The stress test analysis provides unique quantitative insights, linking Fed proposals to specific capital buffer reductions (40 basis points average, 65 basis points otherwise) and calculating that banks could hold 5% of market cap in excess capital for shareholder returns. The wealth management transformation thesis synthesizes Morgan Stanley's strategic shift with specific margin improvements (single digits to mid-20s) and ROE targets (mid-teens to 20s). The trading revenue normalization analysis connects macroeconomic uncertainty to elevated trading levels with specific revenue ranges ($7-9 billion vs $4-5 billion historically). While some sections contain standard DCF assumptions and generic moat discussions, the report's core insights are decision-relevant, quantified, and specific to Morgan Stanley's unique positioning.",
