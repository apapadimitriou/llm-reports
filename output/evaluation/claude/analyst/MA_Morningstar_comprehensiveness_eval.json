    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Mastercard equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across most expected content areas. All major sections are present including analyst note, business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears, economic moat, valuation, risk assessment, capital allocation, and comprehensive financials. The report provides detailed financial projections through 2029 with appropriate sector KPIs like revenue growth, operating margins, and transaction volumes. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (12% revenue CAGR, margin improvement to 61%) to the $500 fair value estimate using DCF methodology. Competitive context is provided through peer comparisons with Visa and American Express. The report maintains consistent sourcing and demonstrates deep analytical depth with minimal redundancy. However, it lacks formal scenario analysis or sensitivity testing beyond the base case projections, which prevents an 'Excellent' rating.",
