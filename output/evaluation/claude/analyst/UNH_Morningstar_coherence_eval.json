    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This UnitedHealth equity research report demonstrates strong coherence overall with clear narrative flow and well-integrated sections. The analyst note effectively introduces DOJ investigations as the central theme, which is consistently referenced throughout the Business Strategy, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, and Risk sections, creating excellent cross-sectional connectivity. The report maintains consistent terminology and provides smooth transitions between ideas, particularly in explaining how regulatory challenges affect different business segments. The Bulls/Bears arguments are well-reconciled with the base-case valuation narrative, acknowledging both the company's competitive advantages and regulatory headwinds. Financial tables align properly with narrative assumptions, including the incorporated $20 billion potential cash outflow and conservative Medicare Advantage margins. Temporal references are accurate throughout, with proper dating of events and investigations. Minor areas for improvement include some dense technical sections in the Economic Moat analysis that could benefit from lighter transitions, but these don't materially detract from the overall coherent argument structure.",
