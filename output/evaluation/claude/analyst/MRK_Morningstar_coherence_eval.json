    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Morningstar equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language, logical flow, and well-integrated sections. The report successfully builds a connected narrative from the acquisition announcement through strategic analysis to valuation conclusions. Key strengths include explicit cross-references between sections (the Verona acquisition connects to growth strategy, pipeline needs, and patent cliff concerns), consistent terminology usage throughout, and smooth transitions that explain why topics follow logically. The Bulls/Bears section effectively reconciles with the base-case narrative about Keytruda's dominance and eventual patent challenges. Financial tables align well with the narrative projections. The temporal accuracy is maintained with proper dating of events and consistent use of 'recent' claims. While there are minor areas where transitions could be slightly smoother, particularly in some of the industry policy discussions in the analyst notes archive, the report maintains strong internal consistency without material contradictions between assumptions, tables, and narrative sections.",

        "Explicit connection between Verona acquisition and strategic needs: 'Merck is facing a major patent cliff in 2028 with the expiration of US patent protection for oncology drug Keytruda and needs to diversify its portfolio' (Analyst Note)",
        "Strong cross-referencing between sections: Bears Say concern about '2028 US patent loss' directly aligns with Fair Value section's expectation that 'Keytruda sales to fall from peak of $41 billion in 2028 to below $10 billion annually by 2032'",
        "Consistent narrative flow from strategy through valuation: Business Strategy section's focus on Keytruda leadership connects seamlessly to Fair Value section's detailed Keytruda projections and patent timeline"
