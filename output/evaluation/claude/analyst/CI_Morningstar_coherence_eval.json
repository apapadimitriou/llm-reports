    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Cigna equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and well-structured analysis. The report flows logically from business description through strategy, moat analysis, valuation, and risks. Key terms like PBM, Evernorth, and specialty pharmacy are consistently used throughout. The narrative effectively connects sections, with the moat analysis supporting the valuation methodology and risk discussions reinforcing the Bears Say concerns about regulatory challenges. The financial tables align well with the narrative projections, showing consistent assumptions about revenue growth and margin expectations. The analyst notes archive provides valuable context and maintains consistent messaging about regulatory risks and fair value adjustments. While there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother, particularly between some subsections, the report maintains internal consistency without material contradictions. The temporal references appear accurate, with recent events properly contextualized within the 2025 reporting timeframe.",
