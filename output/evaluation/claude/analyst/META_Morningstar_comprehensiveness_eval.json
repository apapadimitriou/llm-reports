Peer benchmarking is present through competitive comparisons with Alphabet, Snap, and Pinterest. The analyst provides consistent sourcing throughout with dated references. While the report lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case DCF model, all other comprehensiveness criteria are well-addressed with appropriate depth for the social media sector.",
