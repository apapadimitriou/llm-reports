    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Adobe equity research report covers all major sections expected for equity research with appropriate depth and sector-specific focus. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit DCF methodology, risk analysis, capital allocation evaluation, and extensive financial projections with software-specific KPIs like ARR, net new ARR, and retention metrics. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (revenue growth, margin expansion, AI monetization) to the $560 fair value estimate through detailed DCF analysis. Peer benchmarking is present with competitor comparisons. The report demonstrates consistent sourcing and minimal redundancy. While scenario analysis is not explicitly present as a separate section, the uncertainty rating and multiple valuation metrics provide some sensitivity context. The report meets the threshold for 'Good' with comprehensive coverage, appropriate KPIs, and strong valuation linkage.",
