    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates good quality assumptions across most dimensions. Key assumptions are explicit and well-justified with multi-year history and peer context. The analyst provides specific forecasts with clear units and time horizons (7% compound annual revenue growth through fiscal 2029, iPhone revenue growth of 6%, services growth of 10%, wearables growth of 13%). Gross margins are projected to rise from 46% to 49% by fiscal 2029, with operating margins reaching 35%. The DCF model includes detailed Stage II parameters (8% EBI growth rate, 2% investment rate) and valuation drivers (9% cost of equity, 8.9% WACC). However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers, which caps the grade at Good despite otherwise strong assumption quality.",
