    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic analysis. Key original insights include: (1) a quantified synthesis linking Apple's Safari partnership termination risk to Alphabet's $20 billion annual cost with specific equilibrium scenarios, (2) detailed analysis of Google Search's lower growth trajectory (6% CAGR) versus broader digital advertising (10%) due to AI disruption, (3) specific monetization mechanisms for AI Overviews achieving parity with traditional search, and (4) Google Cloud capacity constraints driving growth deceleration with clear reacceleration catalysts. The report provides decision-relevant analysis with specific numbers, timelines, and catalysts. While some sections contain standard competitive moat analysis, the core insights demonstrate genuine synthesis of multiple data points into actionable investment theses with quantified implications.",
