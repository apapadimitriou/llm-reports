    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic industry commentary. The analysis of Amgen's maritide obesity drug combines clinical trial data (20%-25% vomiting rates, three-step dose escalation) with specific commercial projections ($9 billion 2034 revenue, 5% market share in $200 billion GLP-1 market, 2028 launch timeline). The biosimilar competition analysis synthesizes patent expiration timing with manufacturing cost advantages to project specific margin impacts. The report connects Amgen's human genetics database acquisition to pipeline productivity improvements, and links manufacturing efficiency gains to both margin defense and biosimilar market positioning. Political risk analysis synthesizes RFK Jr.'s nomination with specific drug categories (obesity, vaccines) and regulatory pathway implications. While some standard DCF elements appear, the valuation incorporates novel drivers like probability-weighted pipeline assets (60% maritide approval probability) and IRA-specific adjustments. The insights are quantified, company-specific, and decision-relevant with clear catalysts and timelines.",
