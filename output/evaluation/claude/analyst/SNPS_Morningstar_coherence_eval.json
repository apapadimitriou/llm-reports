    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Synopsys equity research report demonstrates strong structural coherence with clear language and logical flow throughout most sections. The analyst note effectively introduces the China trade situation and connects it to updated fair value estimates. The Business Strategy section smoothly transitions into competitive positioning and growth drivers, while the Economic Moat section provides comprehensive analysis with explicit connections between switching costs, market dominance, and valuation implications. The Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case narrative, addressing both growth potential and risk factors appropriately. Financial tables are consistent with narrative projections, and temporal references are accurate throughout. The report maintains consistent terminology and shows good cross-referencing between sections, particularly linking the China business developments to risk assessments and valuation updates. Minor areas for improvement include some dense paragraphs in the Economic Moat section that could benefit from smoother transitions, but these don't materially detract from the overall coherence.",
