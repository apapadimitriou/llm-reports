    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates good originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic industry commentary. The analyst provides three clear syntheses: linking AI adoption + new product launches (Snowpark) to above-guidance growth expectations, connecting consumption patterns + workload identification to revenue trajectory insights, and synthesizing competitive positioning (cloud-agnostic platform) with switching cost dynamics. The fair value increase from $129 to $165 is supported by specific quantified drivers including 24% product revenue growth guidance and 8% operating margin expectations. The analysis includes decision-relevant catalysts like new product launches and AI sales momentum. While some discussion touches on generic themes like 'long-term data tailwinds,' the core insights are distinctly focused on Snowflake's specific competitive position, product portfolio evolution, and quantified financial pathway, making this analysis actionable and company-specific.",
