{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides several explicit assumptions with clear units and timeframes, including revenue growth expectations (7% annually 2025-2028), specific drug sales forecasts (Keytruda peak $40+ billion, Gardasil $7 billion by 2030), and valuation parameters (7.2% WACC, 3.5% terminal growth). Key assumptions are generally well-justified with historical context and industry benchmarks. However, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rule. While assumptions are mostly consistent internally, the absence of stress-testing through quantified ranges or alternative scenarios represents a significant methodological gap for a pharmaceutical company facing major patent cliffs and regulatory uncertainties.",
