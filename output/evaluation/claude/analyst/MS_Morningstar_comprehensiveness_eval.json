    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive report covers all major sections expected for equity research with appropriate depth and sector-specific focus. The content includes analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, detailed economic moat assessment, valuation methodology, risk analysis, capital allocation evaluation, and extensive financial projections. The financials snapshot provides multi-year history and forecasts with banking-specific KPIs including ROE, ROA, return on tangible equity, net interest margin, and efficiency ratios. Valuation assumptions are explicitly linked to operating drivers through detailed DCF modeling. The report demonstrates consistent sourcing throughout and includes comprehensive peer analysis and ESG assessment. While the report lacks explicit scenario analysis and sensitivity testing that would elevate it to excellent, it represents a thorough, well-structured analysis with minimal redundancy and strong integration of evidence across sections.",
