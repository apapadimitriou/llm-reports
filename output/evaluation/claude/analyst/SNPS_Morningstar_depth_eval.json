    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal explanations and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. The analyst provides detailed mechanisms linking AI demand to \"more chip design starts\" and explains how \"increasing chip complexity\" drives EDA tool demand. Key assumptions are well-quantified and benchmarked: \"11% (11%) CAGR\" for EDA segment, \"13% (13%) CAGR\" for IP segment, and \"7.5% cost of equity\" as the \"lowest discount rate we use.\" The report includes robust causal reasoning such as \"China accounts for nearly 11%\" revenue impact and \"one-month interruption shaves a few basis points.\" However, while the report mentions various risks and scenarios (China restrictions, customer concentration), it lacks comprehensive quantified sensitivity analysis or multiple scenario modeling that would elevate it to Excellent. The actionable implications are clear, particularly regarding the Ansys merger and China trade situation impacts on valuation.",
