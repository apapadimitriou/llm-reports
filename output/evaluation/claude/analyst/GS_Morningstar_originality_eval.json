    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates good originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic banking analysis. The analyst provides strong synthesis linking stress test results to capital buffer reductions and potential shareholder returns (quantifying 40-65 basis points decline, 5% market cap excess capital). The moat upgrade analysis synthesizes Goldman's ecosystem benefits, showing how trading supports investment banking through client relationships. The valuation section offers original insights on margin expansion (490 basis points between 2024-2034) driven by technology investments and consumer banking exit. The compensation ratio target analysis (30% long-term) with specific timeline (2034) shows forward-looking synthesis. While some content restates public information about stress tests and business segments, the analytical framework connecting these elements into actionable investment theses demonstrates clear originality and decision relevance.",
