    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Moderna equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and mostly smooth transitions between sections. The analyst effectively connects the flu vaccine trial results to broader investment themes, explaining how new product launches support the return to profitability narrative. The report maintains consistent terminology throughout (mRNA technology, economic moat, pipeline programs) and shows good cross-referencing between sections - the analyst note references assumptions in the fair value section, and the bulls/bears align with the base-case outlook. The temporal claims are accurate, with recent events properly dated (June 2025 flu vaccine data, April 2025 fair value estimate). Financial projections in the tables align with the narrative expectations of returning to profitability by 2028. However, there are some minor rough edges in transitions between topics within sections, and occasional shifts between discussing specific programs and broader strategic themes could be smoother. The extensive analyst notes archive demonstrates consistent analytical framework over time, reinforcing the coherent investment thesis.",
