    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Boston Scientific equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language, logical flow, and consistent cross-references throughout sections. The narrative follows a coherent arc from business strategy through valuation, with sections effectively reinforcing each other. The analyst consistently connects key themes like Farapulse success and Watchman growth across multiple sections, creating explicit connective tissue. Financial projections in the valuation tables align well with the narrative's optimistic outlook on electrophysiology growth and margin expansion. The Bulls/Bears section appropriately balances the base-case narrative's positive tone with realistic competitive concerns. Terminology is used consistently throughout, and temporal claims align with provided dates. The extensive analyst notes archive reinforces the main narrative themes with concrete quarterly performance data. While there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother and some risk discussions could be more detailed, the report maintains strong internal consistency without material contradictions between assumptions, tables, and narrative sections.",
    "evidence": [
        "Fair value increase from $84 to $93 explicitly tied to 'more optimistic projections for Farapulse and Watchman' with supporting growth rates in valuation tables (Fair Value section)",
        "Bulls/Bears appropriately balanced against base-case optimism, noting 'uphill battle in TAVR market' while supporting Farapulse leadership claims (Bulls/Bears section)",
        "Consistent cross-referencing between sections, such as moat analysis referencing 'coronary stent business strikes us as the least moaty' which aligns with strategy focus on novel technologies (Economic Moat section)"
