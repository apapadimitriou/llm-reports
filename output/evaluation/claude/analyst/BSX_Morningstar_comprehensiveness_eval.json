    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Boston Scientific equity research report demonstrates strong coverage across all major sections with appropriate sector-specific content. The report includes detailed business description, strategy analysis, competitive moat assessment, valuation methodology with DCF modeling, risk analysis, and capital allocation review. The financials snapshot provides multi-year forecasts with relevant medical device KPIs including revenue growth, operating margins, ROIC, and R&D metrics. Peer benchmarking is present with comparative analysis against Abbott, Medtronic, and J&J. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (Farapulse adoption, Watchman growth, margin expansion) to fair value assumptions through detailed DCF analysis. ESG considerations are appropriately integrated. While the report lacks formal scenario analysis with sensitivity ranges, it provides robust fundamental analysis with consistent sourcing throughout.",
