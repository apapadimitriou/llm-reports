    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major sections expected for equity research. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with profit drivers, risk analysis, capital allocation, and extensive financials with biotechnology-specific KPIs. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (like maritide obesity drug sales, biosimilar competition timing, and pipeline progression) to fair value assumptions. Evidence citations are consistent throughout with dated analyst notes and specific data points. The report includes peer analysis with Novartis and Regeneron, and provides scenario analysis through multiple analyst notes covering different outcomes. While extremely thorough, it falls just short of 'Excellent' due to limited formal sensitivity analysis tables, though scenario thinking is embedded throughout the analyst commentary.",
