    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal explanations and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. The analyst provides strong causal reasoning throughout, explaining that \"cost control\" drives margin resilience and \"wallet share gains\" fuel organic growth above industry rates. Key assumptions are well-quantified and benchmarked: \"7% cost of capital,\" \"5%-6% per year organically,\" and \"100 basis points of top-line benefit\" from acquisitions. The report includes meaningful counterpoint analysis, noting \"tariffs introduce uncertainty\" and examining scenarios like \"5% earnings reduction\" from tariff impact. However, while the report touches on sensitivities around China demand and tariff effects, it lacks comprehensive quantified scenario analysis with multiple outcome ranges. The actionable implications are clear and decision-relevant, explaining how the company's competitive positioning and cost management enable it to weather current headwinds while positioning for recovery.",
