    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Amazon equity research report demonstrates strong coverage across all major sections expected in institutional equity research. The report includes thorough business description, strategy outlook, competitive moat analysis, valuation methodology, risk assessment, and capital allocation evaluation. The financial snapshot provides multi-year forecasts with appropriate metrics including revenue growth, operating margins, ROIC, and DCF valuation components. Peer comparison includes relevant competitors (Microsoft, Walmart, eBay) with key metrics. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (AWS growth at 16% CAGR, advertising at 17% CAGR, retail at 8% CAGR) to the $240 fair value estimate through detailed DCF modeling. ESG coverage addresses material risks appropriately. While the report lacks formal scenario analysis and sensitivity testing around key assumptions, the depth of analysis, consistent sourcing, and comprehensive coverage of all expected content areas with sector-appropriate detail justifies a Good rating.",
