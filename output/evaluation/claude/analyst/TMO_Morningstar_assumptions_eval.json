{
    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid assumption quality across most pillars. Key assumptions are explicit and proximal to forecasts, with clear units and time horizons (5%-6% organic growth, 7% WACC, 100 basis points inorganic growth). Justification is solid, referencing historical performance (4%-5% organic growth vs 3% industry over past decade), peer comparisons, and market conditions. Specificity is comprehensive with detailed financial projections and clear drivers. Internal consistency is clean with no contradictions found between narrative and tables. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like growth rates, margins, or WACC, which caps the grade at Good rather than Excellent. The assumptions are well-grounded and traceable but would benefit from robust stress-testing to achieve the highest rating.",
