    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Amgen equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and logical structure that flows from market context through detailed analysis to valuation conclusions. The report effectively integrates multiple sections, with the Analyst Note connecting to Business Strategy discussions of maritide's obesity market potential, which aligns with Fair Value assumptions of $9 billion peak sales and 2028 launch timeline. Financial projections in the valuation tables support the narrative's growth expectations, showing revenue increases from newer drugs offsetting biosimilar pressures on legacy products like Prolia/Xgeva. The Bulls/Bears section appropriately balances optimism about pipeline revival and manufacturing efficiency against concerns about biosimilar competition and market focus, which reconciles well with the base-case wide moat rating and $333 fair value estimate. Temporal references are accurate throughout, with recent events like June 2025 maritide data properly contextualized. The Economic Moat section provides strong connective tissue explaining how intangible assets support the valuation assumptions. Minor areas for improvement include some dense technical transitions and occasional lengthy paragraphs in the pipeline discussions, but these don't materially detract from the report's overall analytical coherence.",
    "evidence": [
        "Analyst Note states 'We continue to see a 2028 launch and $9 billion in 2034 revenue as a realistic base-case scenario' which directly aligns with Fair Value section's 'probability-adjusted sales of $8 billion in 2033' for maritide",
        "Bears Say section notes 'Pressure on Prolia/Xgeva is coming in 2025' which reconciles with Business Strategy's acknowledgment of biosimilar headwinds while maintaining growth through newer drugs",
        "Financial tables show revenue growth from $35.7B (2025) to $40.5B (2029) supporting the narrative's thesis that newer products will offset legacy drug declines"
