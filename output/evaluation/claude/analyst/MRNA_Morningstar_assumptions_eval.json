    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates partial explicitness with key assumptions stated but scattered throughout the narrative. Revenue assumptions are reasonably specific ($2 billion annual covid sales, $7 billion infectious disease vaccines by 2034, $3 billion from mRNA-4157 by 2034). The WACC of 9% is explicitly stated and justified as 'in line with early commercial-stage biotech peers.' However, justification relies heavily on probability assessments (60% for mRNA-4157, 70% for flu vaccines) without robust historical or peer benchmarks. Internal consistency appears clean with no major contradictions found. The critical limitation is the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise solid assumptions.",
