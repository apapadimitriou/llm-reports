    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This BlackRock equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language and logical flow throughout most sections. The analyst note effectively introduces the ElmTree acquisition and connects it to BlackRock's private markets strategy, while the Business Strategy section provides smooth transitions from industry headwinds to BlackRock's positioning advantages. The Economic Moat section builds systematically from general industry characteristics to BlackRock's specific competitive advantages, with explicit cross-references to switching costs and intangible assets. The Fair Value section logically connects assumptions to valuation methodology and scenario analysis. Bulls/Bears points align well with the base-case narrative around passive products, scale advantages, and performance pressures. Financial tables consistently support the narrative projections for organic growth rates and margin expectations. Temporal references are accurate, with recent acquisitions properly contextualized within the past year timeframe. The report maintains consistent terminology throughout, particularly around AUM, organic growth rates, and margin metrics. Minor areas for improvement include some transitions between subsections that could be more explicit, and the Capital Allocation section could better connect to valuation assumptions, but these represent relatively minor rough edges in an otherwise well-structured analysis.",
