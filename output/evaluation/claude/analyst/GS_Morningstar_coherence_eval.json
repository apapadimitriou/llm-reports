    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Goldman Sachs equity research report demonstrates strong structural coherence with clear narrative flow and comprehensive cross-referencing between sections. The analyst effectively connects the stress test results in the opening note to valuation concerns about overvaluation, creating a cohesive investment thesis. The Business Strategy section smoothly transitions into the Bulls/Bears analysis, which appropriately balances cyclical opportunities against trading revenue volatility and regulatory risks. The Economic Moat section provides extensive justification for the wide moat rating through detailed segment analysis, effectively supporting the Fair Value section's upgraded estimates and ROE targets. Financial projections in the valuation tables align well with the narrative assumptions about margin expansion and revenue growth. The report maintains consistent terminology throughout and demonstrates strong temporal accuracy with all dates properly contextualized. Minor areas for improvement include some dense paragraphs in the Economic Moat section that could benefit from smoother transitions, and the Bulls/Bears points, while substantive, could be more explicitly reconciled with the base-case scenarios in the valuation discussion.",
