    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Morningstar equity research report covers all major sections expected for healthcare plan analysis with strong sector-specific focus. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategic outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation methodology, risk analysis, capital allocation review, and extensive financial projections. Healthcare-specific KPIs are well-represented including medical loss ratios, star ratings, membership metrics, and margin analysis appropriate for Medicare Advantage insurers. The valuation section explicitly links operational drivers (MA membership growth, margin recovery, regulatory changes) to DCF assumptions and fair value estimates. Evidence is consistently cited with specific dates and sources. The report demonstrates strong peer context through competitive analysis and regulatory environment discussion. Minor gaps include limited scenario analysis beyond bull/bear cases and some repetition of Medicare Advantage challenges across sections, but overall depth and industry expertise are excellent.",
