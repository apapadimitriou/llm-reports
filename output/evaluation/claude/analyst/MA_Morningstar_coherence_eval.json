    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Mastercard equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language and well-structured narrative flow. The report follows a logical progression from analyst note through business strategy, competitive analysis, valuation, and risks. Sections effectively cross-reference each other, such as the Economic Moat section supporting the valuation assumptions and the Bulls/Bears perspectives aligning with the base-case outlook. The analyst consistently uses terminology throughout, and financial projections in the tables align well with the narrative discussions. Temporal references are accurate, with recent analyst notes properly dated and contextualized. The stablecoin discussion in the opening analyst note connects logically to the competitive moat analysis and risk assessment. While there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother, such as between some subsections in the capital allocation discussion, the overall argument flows coherently from the company's competitive advantages through to valuation conclusions. The Bulls/Bears section appropriately balances the base-case narrative without creating unresolved contradictions.",
    "evidence": [
        "Economic Moat section explicitly supports Fair Value assumptions: 'network effect and resulting cost advantage is strong enough to lead to a wide moat' directly connects to $500 fair value estimate",
        "Bulls/Bears perspectives align with base-case: Bulls emphasize 'plenty of runway for growth in electronic payments' while Bears note 'distant number-two player' concerns, both reconciled in the balanced outlook",
        "Analyst Notes Archive shows consistent temporal progression with proper dating from May 2025 back to June 2024, maintaining chronological accuracy"
