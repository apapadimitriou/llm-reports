    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates at least two clear syntheses and one original thesis that are decision-relevant and company-specific. The analyst synthesizes stablecoin merchant adoption trends with consumer payment preferences to conclude minimal threat to Visa's network effects. The analysis of cross-border volume recovery patterns and their normalization provides quantified insights with specific growth rates (16% to 13% sequential decline). The report also synthesizes margin dynamics by linking cross-border transaction recovery with client incentive growth to project operating margin improvement from 48% to 49% by 2029. These insights go beyond generic payment industry commentary and provide actionable, Visa-specific perspectives with concrete numbers and catalysts. The valuation includes novel drivers around international market growth and cross-border normalization rather than standard DCF assumptions.",
