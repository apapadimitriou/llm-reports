    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid assumption quality across most key pillars. Assumptions are explicitly stated throughout with clear specificity - revenue growth projections (34% in 2025), operating margin expansion (low-30s to mid-40s), terminal growth (5%), and WACC (7.3%). Justification is robust, incorporating multi-year history, peer benchmarks, and industry-specific insights like GLP-1 market projections reaching $200 billion by 2031. The financial tables show strong internal consistency with narrative forecasts. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers beyond qualitative risk discussions, which prevents an Excellent rating despite the otherwise comprehensive treatment of assumptions.",
