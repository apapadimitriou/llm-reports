    "summary_reasoning": "This Microsoft report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. The analyst provides strong causal explanations like \"Revenue increased 13% year over year driven by surging Azure commitments\" and \"Azure growth was 35% driven by AI demand.\" The report includes explicit, quantified assumptions such as \"5-year CAGR for revenue of approximately 13%\" and \"operating margins increasing from 45% to 46%\" with benchmarked valuation multiples (\"EV/sales multiple of 13 times, P/E of 38 times\"). However, the report lacks comprehensive scenario analysis or sensitivity testing. While it mentions capacity constraints and competitive risks, it doesn't quantify how different scenarios would impact valuations or provide ranges around key assumptions. The actionable implications are clear (\"shares as attractive, stock remains one of our top picks\") but could be more conditional on specific outcomes.",
