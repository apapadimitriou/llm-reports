    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Meta equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language and logical flow throughout most sections. The analyst note effectively introduces WhatsApp monetization and connects to the broader investment thesis. The Business Strategy & Outlook section smoothly transitions from user-side to advertising-side strategies, while the Economic Moat section provides detailed analysis with explicit connections between network effects, data assets, and competitive advantages. Bulls/Bears points align well with the base-case narrative around advertising growth and AI investments. The financial tables support the narrative projections consistently. However, there are some minor rough edges in transitions between certain sections, and the lengthy Economic Moat discussion could benefit from tighter organization. The temporal references are accurate throughout, and the $770 fair value estimate is well-supported by the DCF assumptions and growth forecasts presented.",
    "evidence": [
        "Analyst Note clearly states 'we maintain our $770 fair value estimate for wide-moat Meta, with WhatsApp monetization already baked into our growth forecasts' - directly connecting new developments to valuation",
        "Bulls/Bears section aligns with base case, citing 'improved ad targeting and content recommendation algorithms' in Bulls and 'investments in Reality Labs and generative AI stand to lose billions' in Bears, matching the Fair Value section's optimism on AI for ads but caution on other investments",
        "Financial tables show consistent 12% CAGR revenue growth forecast matching the Fair Value section's statement of '12% compound annual growth rate for the next five years'"
