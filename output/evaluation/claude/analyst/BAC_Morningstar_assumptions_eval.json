{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are partially explicit but lack sufficient detail and justification. Key drivers like the 9.5% cost of equity, 14% midcycle ROTE, and specific NII growth projections (6.8% in 2025) are clearly stated. However, critical assumptions such as the 2.5% expense CAGR, 0.62% terminal charge-off rate, and Stage II growth rate of 3.0% receive minimal justification beyond brief commentary. The report provides some quantitative forecasts with units and timeframes, but many rely on management guidance rather than independent analysis. Most significantly, there are no sensitivity analyses or scenario testing for any material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite the presence of some well-articulated assumptions.",
