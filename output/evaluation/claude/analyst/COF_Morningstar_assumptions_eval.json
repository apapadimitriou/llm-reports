    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit assumptions that are reasonably well-justified with historical context and peer comparisons. Key drivers like credit card growth (5.8% annually), efficiency ratio (ending at 56% by 2028), and credit costs (3.21% in 2025, declining to 2.83% by 2027) are clearly stated with specific units and timeframes. The assumptions are generally consistent with the financial tables and supported by historical performance data. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers. While risks are discussed qualitatively (economic cycles, credit quality concerns), there are no quantified ranges showing how changes in key assumptions would impact the valuation or target price. The cost of equity (9.0%) and terminal growth assumptions are stated but without detailed justification. Without robust sensitivity analysis on material levers, the grade is capped at Fair despite otherwise solid assumption quality.",
