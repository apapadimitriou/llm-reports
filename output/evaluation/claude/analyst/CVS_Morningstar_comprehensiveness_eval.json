    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This CVS Health report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major sections expected for equity research. The analyst provides detailed analysis of business description, strategy, competitive positioning (economic moat), valuation methodology with explicit DCF modeling, risk assessment, and capital allocation. The financials section includes multi-year historical data and forecasts with healthcare-specific KPIs like medical loss ratios, member counts, and adjusted claims. Valuation assumptions are clearly linked to operating drivers through detailed DCF analysis. The report includes robust peer benchmarking against major competitors (Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealth) and addresses sector-specific regulatory risks. ESG considerations are integrated throughout. While the report lacks formal scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case, the depth of analysis, consistent sourcing, and comprehensive coverage of all expected content areas with minimal redundancy supports a Good rating.",
