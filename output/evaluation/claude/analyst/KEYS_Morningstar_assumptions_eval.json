{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates moderate explicitness with key assumptions clearly stated in dedicated sections, particularly valuation drivers. Justification is partial - revenue growth assumptions are supported by recent guidance and market context, margin assumptions reference historical trends and mix shifts, but WACC components lack detailed sourcing. Specificity is solid with clear units, timeframes, and magnitudes throughout the financial forecasts. Internal consistency is clean with no contradictions found between narrative and tables. However, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise solid assumption quality.",
