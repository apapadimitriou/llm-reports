    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This AMD equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and logical flow between sections. The narrative arc from the analyst note through business strategy, valuation, and risks is well-structured and interconnected. The report effectively cross-references key themes across sections, particularly AMD's AI GPU opportunities, x86 market position, and competitive dynamics with Intel and Nvidia. The Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case narrative, acknowledging both AMD's manufacturing partnership advantages and software challenges versus Nvidia. Financial projections in the valuation section are consistent with the strategic outlook, showing realistic growth assumptions tied to market share gains and AI adoption. The temporal claims are accurate, with the July 2025 analyst note properly referencing the 90-day-old China ban from April 2025. Technical terminology is used consistently throughout, and the detailed financial tables support rather than contradict the narrative assumptions. While there are minor rough edges in some transitions between subsections, the report maintains strong internal consistency and provides a coherent investment thesis that readers can follow without having to reconstruct the argument themselves.",
    "evidence": [
        "The analyst note clearly states 'This raise is the inverse of our cut in April to $120 from $140 when the ban was implemented' - demonstrating precise temporal accuracy and cross-referencing with prior analysis",
        "Bulls/Bears section aligns with base case, noting 'AMD will need to improve its software capabilities to make a dent in Nvidia's AI dominance' which reconciles with the cautious AI growth projections in the valuation section",
        "Financial projections show internal consistency - the $1.2B revenue reinsertion for 2025 and $2.8B for 2029 mentioned in the analyst note matches the detailed AI GPU revenue forecasts in the valuation tables"
