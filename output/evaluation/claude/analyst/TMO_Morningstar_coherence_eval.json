    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Thermo Fisher Scientific equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language, logical flow, and well-integrated sections. The narrative arc flows smoothly from current challenges through strategic positioning to valuation, with each section reinforcing the central thesis. The Business Strategy & Outlook effectively sets up the Bears Say concerns about China weakness and academic/government softness, which are then reconciled in the Fair Value section's expectation for 2026 normalization. The Economic Moat section provides detailed support for the wide moat rating with specific examples of switching costs and market positioning. Financial projections in the valuation model align consistently with the narrative assumptions about margin improvement and growth recovery. The analyst notes archive demonstrates temporal consistency, tracking the company's performance evolution logically. While there are minor areas where transitions could be slightly smoother, the report maintains internal consistency between assumptions, tables, and narrative throughout.",
    "evidence": [
        "Bulls/Bears reconciled in Fair Value section: Bears cite China weakness and academic softness, while valuation assumes 'current constrained environment to remain in 2025, but slowly return to historic mid-single-digit growth in the following year'",
        "Financial tables align with narrative: projected operating margin improvement from 18.2% (2025) to 22.2% (2029) supports the text's claim that 'adjusted operating margin will steadily improve over the next five years'",
        "Economic Moat section provides specific evidence: 'revenue is nearly equal to the next three largest life science suppliers combined' and 'salesforce is four times its largest peer' supporting wide moat rating"
