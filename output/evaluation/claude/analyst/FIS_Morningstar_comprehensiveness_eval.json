    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across all major sections. It includes thorough coverage of business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit DCF methodology, risk analysis, and capital allocation. The financials section provides multi-year historical and forecast data with appropriate technology services KPIs including revenue growth, EBITDA margins, ROE, ROIC, and free cash flow metrics. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (4% revenue CAGR, margin improvements) to the $88 fair value through detailed DCF assumptions. Peer benchmarking is present with competitor analysis. The report maintains consistent sourcing and minimal redundancy. While it lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the DCF model, all other comprehensive elements are well-executed.",
