    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic analysis. Key original insights include: (1) quantifying Adobe's AI monetization at $160M ARR trending to $250M, with specific tiered pricing from free to $200/user/month, (2) synthesizing the AI disruption controversy with a specific threshold analysis (300 basis points annual revenue decline needed to justify current price), and (3) connecting Adobe's funnel strategy (Express \u2192 AI usage \u2192 conversion) to concrete performance metrics. The analyst provides decision-relevant theses with specific numbers, timelines, and catalysts. While some discussion of switching costs and moat characteristics covers familiar territory, the core investment thesis around AI integration and monetization shows clear analytical synthesis rather than generic commentary.",
