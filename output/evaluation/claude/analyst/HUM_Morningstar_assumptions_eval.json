    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates partial explicitness with some key assumptions stated, particularly around valuation drivers like WACC (8.2%), cost of equity (9.0%), and terminal growth (4.0%). However, critical revenue growth and margin assumptions driving the forecasts lack sufficient detail and justification. The justification is weak overall - while some parameters reference historical context or peer comparisons, most lack robust supporting evidence. Specificity is partial with some units and timeframes provided in the DCF model, but operational assumptions remain vague. Internal consistency shows minor issues with some narrative-table alignment concerns. Most critically, the report provides no quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers, only qualitative scenario mentions (bull case vs. base case), which caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rule.",
