    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic industry commentary. The analyst provides unique insights linking BlackRock's passive product dominance to its competitive positioning, synthesizes acquisition strategy with private market expansion goals, and offers detailed quantitative analysis of organic growth patterns with specific targets and timeframes. The valuation section presents novel drivers including the scalability thesis for ETF operations and margin expansion forecasts. While some standard asset management themes appear, the report consistently adds interpretive value through BlackRock-specific analysis, quantified projections (4.4% organic growth, 43-47% operating margins), and actionable investment theses with clear catalysts.",
