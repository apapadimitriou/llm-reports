    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Eli Lilly equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and well-structured sections that reinforce each other effectively. The report flows logically from the analyst note discussing regulatory risks through business strategy, valuation assumptions, and risk assessment. The narrative maintains consistency between the Bulls/Bears section and base-case valuation, with both emphasizing GLP-1 drugs' growth potential while acknowledging competition and regulatory risks. Financial tables align well with narrative projections, showing strong revenue growth driven by Mounjaro/Zepbound sales as discussed throughout. The analyst appropriately references cross-sections, such as connecting fair value increases to orforglipron assumptions and linking risk ratings to product concentration concerns. Terminology is used consistently, and temporal references align with provided dates. While there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother and some assumptions could be more explicitly connected across sections, the report reads as a cohesive analytical framework rather than disconnected components.",
    "evidence": [
        "Fair value increase 'to $650 per share from $620, after raising our assumptions for potential orforglipron sales' explicitly connects valuation changes to specific pipeline assumptions (Fair Value section)",
        "Bulls/Bears section emphasizes both GLP-1 leadership opportunities and competition risks, which aligns with base-case projections of strong growth tempered by pricing pressure assumptions",
        "Financial tables show 34% projected 2025 revenue growth matching narrative emphasis on Mounjaro/Zepbound driving 'industry-leading growth' (Business Strategy section)"
