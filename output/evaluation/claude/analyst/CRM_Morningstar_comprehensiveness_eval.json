    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Salesforce equity research report demonstrates strong coverage across all major sections with appropriate depth and sector-specific focus. The report includes detailed analyst notes, thorough business description, strategic outlook, competitive positioning with economic moat analysis, explicit valuation methodology with DCF modeling, risk assessment, and capital allocation analysis. The financials snapshot provides multi-year historical data and forecasts with relevant SaaS metrics including revenue growth, operating margins, and cash flow metrics. While the report includes competitor analysis and some peer benchmarking data, it lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case DCF model. The valuation section effectively links operating drivers to fair value assumptions through detailed margin and growth projections. Evidence citations are consistent throughout with proper sourcing, and redundancy is minimal across sections.",
