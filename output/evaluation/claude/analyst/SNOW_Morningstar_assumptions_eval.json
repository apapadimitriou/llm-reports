{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report explicitly states key assumptions including revenue growth rates (23% CAGR over 5 years, 20% over 10 years), margin expansion (gross margins from 67% to 80%, operating margins from -40% to 26%), and valuation multiples (13x forward EV/sales). These assumptions are clearly positioned near forecasts and include specific units and timeframes. Justification is partial, with some historical context and peer awareness but limited quantitative benchmarking. The assumptions show good specificity with clear magnitudes and horizons. However, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise solid assumption quality. Internal consistency appears clean with no contradictions identified between narrative and tables.",
