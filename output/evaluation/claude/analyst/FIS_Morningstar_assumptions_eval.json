{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit key assumptions with clear locations in valuation tables, including cost of equity (7.5%), revenue CAGR (4%), and margin improvement (40 basis points annually). Justification is partial - some assumptions reference historical context and peer comparisons, but lack comprehensive supporting evidence. Specificity is solid with clear units, timeframes, and magnitudes across financial projections. Internal consistency is maintained with no contradictions between narrative and tables. However, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite other strengths. The assumptions are well-structured and traceable but would benefit from robust stress-testing to demonstrate valuation impact under different scenarios.",
