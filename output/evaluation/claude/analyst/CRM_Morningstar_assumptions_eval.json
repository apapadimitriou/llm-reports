{
    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong explicitness with clearly stated assumptions proximal to forecasts and comprehensive financial projections. Justification is solid, with revenue growth supported by market size data ($248 billion TAM), historical performance context, and peer benchmarks. Specificity is comprehensive, providing precise units, timeframes, and drivers across all major assumptions. Internal consistency is clean with no contradictions found between narrative and financial tables. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like revenue growth, margins, or WACC, which caps the grade at Good despite otherwise strong fundamentals.",
