    "summary_reasoning": "This S&P Global equity research report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major sections with strong sector-appropriate content. The report includes detailed business description, thorough economic moat analysis, explicit valuation methodology with DCF modeling, comprehensive risk assessment, and extensive capital allocation discussion. The financials section provides multi-year forecasts with relevant KPIs including revenue growth, operating margins, ROIC, and debt ratios appropriate for a financial services company. Peer benchmarking is present with detailed competitor analysis. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (bond issuance, GDP growth, pricing power) to fair value assumptions through explicit DCF methodology. Sources are consistently cited throughout with proper attribution. While the report lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case DCF model, all other comprehensiveness criteria are well met with appropriate depth and minimal redundancy.",
