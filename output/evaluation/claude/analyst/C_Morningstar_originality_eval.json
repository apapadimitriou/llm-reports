    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains primarily generic restatements and copied content with minimal original synthesis. While it provides extensive company detail, most insights are standard banking analysis points that could apply broadly across the sector. The stress test analysis offers some synthesis by connecting lower capital requirements to potential shareholder returns, but this remains relatively generic. The moat analysis extensively rehashes standard banking competitive factors without novel company-specific angles. The valuation section lacks innovative drivers, relying on standard DCF methodology with conventional assumptions. The report demonstrates thorough research but fails to provide the distinctive, decision-relevant insights needed for a higher grade.",
