    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms linking business drivers to financial outcomes. The analyst provides explicit quantified assumptions including \"WACC of 7.1%\" and \"peak sales around $3 billion\" for Leqembi. Causal explanations are well-developed, such as \"MS sales declining nearly 10% annually\" due to \"branded competition, generic pressure on Tecfidera, and biosimilar Tysabri launches.\" The report includes benchmarked assumptions like \"ROICs to exceed our 7.1% cost of capital\" and considers counterpoints including \"wide range of outcomes for Leqembi's peak revenue.\" However, while the report acknowledges uncertainty and provides some sensitivity context, it lacks comprehensive quantified scenario analysis with multiple probability-weighted outcomes that would elevate it to excellent. The actionable implications are clear, with specific investment thesis tied to drug pipeline success and competitive positioning.",
