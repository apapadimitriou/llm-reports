    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report contains some company-specific details but lacks original synthesis and provides mostly generic insights applicable to the broader payments industry. While it offers detailed financial projections and discusses Mastercard's competitive position, the analysis primarily restates well-known characteristics like network effects, scale advantages, and cross-border recovery trends without novel interpretive angles. The stablecoin discussion represents the closest attempt at original analysis, but it remains surface-level without deep mechanistic insights or quantified implications. The valuation section relies on standard DCF methodology with incremental fair value adjustments but lacks novel drivers or unique analytical frameworks that would distinguish this analysis from typical sector coverage.",
