    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across most expected content areas. All major sections are present including analyst note, business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation analysis, risk & uncertainty, capital allocation, and comprehensive financials. The report excels in competitive positioning with detailed moat analysis and peer comparisons. The financials snapshot is robust with multi-year historical data and forecasts, appropriate sector KPIs for technology instruments (revenue, margins, ROIC, EPS), and detailed DCF valuation model. Evidence citation is generally consistent throughout with proper sourcing. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers to fair value through explicit DCF methodology. However, the report lacks formal scenario analysis or sensitivity testing beyond the base case, preventing an 'Excellent' rating despite otherwise comprehensive coverage.",
