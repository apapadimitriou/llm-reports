    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for most key valuation drivers, with clear units and timeframes. Peak sales forecasts are well-articulated (Prolia/Xgeva $6.6B, Repatha $3B, Tezspire $3B) and the 60% probability weighting for maritide is transparent. Cost of capital assumptions are clearly stated (7% WACC, 7.5% cost of equity, 16% tax rate). However, justification is mixed - while some assumptions reference historical performance and industry context, others lack detailed supporting evidence. The report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like drug sales, cost assumptions, or market penetration rates. This absence of stress-testing caps the grade at Fair despite the otherwise solid presentation of assumptions.",
