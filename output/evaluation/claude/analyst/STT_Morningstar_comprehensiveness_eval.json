    "summary_reasoning": "This State Street equity research report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major sections expected for financial services analysis. The report includes thorough analyst notes, detailed business description and strategy, comprehensive economic moat analysis, explicit valuation methodology with DCF modeling, robust risk assessment, and detailed capital allocation discussion. The financials snapshot provides multi-year forecasts with key banking metrics including NIM, ROE, ROTE, and efficiency ratios. Peer benchmarking is present with comparative analysis against Northern Trust, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (fee revenue growth, NII trends, expense management) to fair value outcomes through detailed DCF assumptions. Sources are consistently cited throughout with specific dates and analyst attributions. ESG considerations are appropriately addressed. While scenario analysis could be more explicit, the report meets all core requirements for comprehensive equity research with appropriate sector-specific depth.",
