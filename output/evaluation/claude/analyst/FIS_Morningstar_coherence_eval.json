    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Morningstar equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and well-structured sections that reinforce each other effectively. The narrative flows logically from FIS's strategic transformation through the Worldpay divestiture to its current focus on bank technology operations. The analyst consistently uses terminology throughout, and the Bulls/Bears section aligns well with the base-case valuation narrative of stable but lower-growth prospects. Financial projections in the tables align with the narrative's modest growth expectations (4% revenue CAGR). The Economic Moat analysis connects directly to the valuation assumptions about competitive positioning. While there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother, particularly between some subsections, and the extensive analyst notes archive creates some repetition, these represent minor rough edges rather than material coherence issues. The temporal references are accurate, with all dates properly aligned with the report's perspective.",
    "evidence": [
        "Clear narrative arc from Strategy section: 'FIS has more recently decided to undo the Worldpay deal' connects to Fair Value section: 'With the company now focused on its more mature bank tech operations, we expect only modest revenue growth'",
        "Bulls/Bears align with valuation: Bears note 'FIS' bank technology operations are tied to a mature industry, which limits its growth prospects' matches projection of '4% revenue CAGR over the next five years'",
        "Financial tables support narrative claims: projected revenue growth of 3.2% in 2025 aligns with text stating 'modest revenue growth over time'"
