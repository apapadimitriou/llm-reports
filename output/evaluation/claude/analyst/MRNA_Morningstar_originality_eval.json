    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong originality through multiple company-specific syntheses and one clear original thesis. The analyst synthesizes complex regulatory, competitive, and pipeline dynamics into actionable insights, such as linking Kennedy's FDA appointments to specific approval probabilities and timelines. The report goes beyond generic biotech analysis by quantifying specific catalysts (26.6% flu vaccine efficacy vs competitors, 70% probability estimates for combination vaccines, $2B annual sales projections). The original thesis connecting regulatory headwinds under Kennedy to reduced approval probabilities with specific fair value adjustments ($85 vs $102) shows clear causal reasoning. The analysis of mRNA platform advantages in manufacturing speed (1-2 months vs 6-9 months for traditional vaccines) and the strategic focus on 10 priority programs by 2027 provides decision-relevant, company-specific insights with concrete timelines and mechanisms.",
