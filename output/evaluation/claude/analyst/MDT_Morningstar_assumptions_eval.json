    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit assumptions in key areas including revenue growth (4% through fiscal 2029), operating margin expansion (200 basis points improvement peaking at 21% in fiscal 2029), and DCF parameters (WACC 7.1%, Stage II EBI growth 6%). These assumptions are clearly stated and proximal to forecasts. Justification is partial, with some historical context and industry benchmarks mentioned but limited depth. Specificity is solid with clear units, timeframes, and magnitudes provided. Internal consistency appears clean with no apparent contradictions between narrative and financial tables. However, the report completely lacks sensitivity analysis or scenario testing on material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite other strengths.",
