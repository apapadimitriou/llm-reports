    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. The analyst provides solid causal explanations like \"AWS and advertising growth should continue to outpace e-commerce growth\" driving margin expansion, and \"higher margins than the corporate average, which in turn should allow both operating profit and EPS to outgrow revenue.\" Key assumptions are quantified and benchmarked: \"retail-related revenue growing at an 8% compound annual growth rate,\" \"AWS revenue growing at a 16% CAGR,\" and \"advertising revenue growing at a 17% CAGR.\" The DCF model includes specific parameters like \"WACC ~8.7%\" and detailed financial projections. However, the report lacks comprehensive scenario analysis or quantified sensitivity testing. While it mentions risks like regulatory concerns and competitive pressures, it doesn't provide explicit downside/upside scenarios with quantified impacts on valuation. The actionable implications are clear: shares are \"fairly valued\" at current prices with specific price targets.",
