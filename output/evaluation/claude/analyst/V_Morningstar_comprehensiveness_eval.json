    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across all major sections. It includes thorough coverage of analyst notes, business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit DCF methodology, risk analysis, capital allocation, and extensive financial snapshots with multi-year forecasts. The report provides sector-appropriate KPIs for payment processing (transaction volumes, cross-border volumes, payment volume growth, operating margins) and maintains consistent sourcing throughout. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers like volume growth and margin expansion to the $306 fair value estimate. Peer benchmarking is present with detailed competitor analysis of Mastercard and American Express. The report includes comprehensive ESG analysis and extensive appendices. While scenario analysis is not explicitly present, the report's depth, consistency, and comprehensive coverage of all expected areas warrants a Good rating.",
