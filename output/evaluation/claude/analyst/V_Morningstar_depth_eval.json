    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal explanations and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. The analyst provides strong causal reasoning, explaining that 'cross-border transactions saw dramatic declines during the pandemic due a reduction in global travel' and 'the scalability of the business should allow the company to modestly expand its already ample margins over time.' Key assumptions are explicit and benchmarked: 'We use a 9% cost of equity,' 'We project gross and net revenue to grow at 10% and 9% compound annual rates,' and 'We project operating margin (based on gross revenue) to improve modestly from 48% in fiscal 2024 to 49% by fiscal 2029.' The report includes some counterpoint analysis, noting risks like 'A downturn in the economy would slow growth' and regulatory concerns. However, the report lacks comprehensive scenario analysis or quantified sensitivity testing that would elevate it to excellent. While growth rates and margin assumptions are provided, there are no explicit ranges or stress tests showing how changes in key variables would impact valuation.",
