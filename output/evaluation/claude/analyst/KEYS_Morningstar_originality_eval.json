    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go well beyond generic industry commentary. Key original insights include: (1) Linking AI demand growth to specific business segments (data center/chip testing offsetting wireless/automotive weakness) with quantified impacts, (2) Synthesizing tariff exposure ($100M annually, 200bp margin impact) with mitigation timeline and China manufacturing positioning, (3) Connecting orders exceeding revenue to forward growth indicators with specific timing catalysts, and (4) Integrating acquisition delays (Spirent, Ansys/Synopsys assets) with portfolio expansion strategy. The analysis provides decision-relevant, company-specific perspectives with clear mechanisms, numbers, and catalysts rather than relying on boilerplate industry themes. The valuation section maintains the $157 fair value with specific reasoning tied to guidance alignment and cyclical positioning.",
