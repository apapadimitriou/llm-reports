    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This IQVIA equity research report demonstrates clear language and mostly smooth transitions throughout its sections. The narrative flows logically from the analyst note through business strategy, competitive analysis, and valuation sections. Key terms like CRO, TAS, and R&DS are consistently defined and used appropriately. The report effectively cross-references between sections, with the Economic Moat section supporting the narrow moat rating mentioned in the Analyst Note, and the Fair Value section aligning with Bulls/Bears arguments about data advantages and outsourcing trends. Financial projections in the tables align well with narrative forecasts of 5% 2025 revenue growth and 7% compound annual growth. The Bulls/Bears section appropriately balances the base-case optimism about data advantages and CRO leadership with legitimate concerns about regulatory changes and competitive pressures. Temporal references are accurate, with recent events properly contextualized within the report's May 2025 timeframe. Minor areas for improvement include some transitions between technical topics that could be smoother, and the extensive historical analyst notes section that occasionally reads somewhat list-like, though the core analytical sections maintain strong coherence.",
    "evidence": [
        "Strong cross-referencing between sections, e.g., 'narrow-moat IQVIA remains resilient' in Analyst Note aligns with detailed Economic Moat analysis of intangible assets and switching costs",
        "Financial forecasts align with narrative: '5% revenue growth' projection matches table showing 16,189M to 15,405M revenue growth",
        "Bulls/Bears section appropriately balances base case, citing 'unparalleled database' advantages while acknowledging 'data privacy regulation' risks"
