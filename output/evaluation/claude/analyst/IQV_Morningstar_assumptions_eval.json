    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates partial explicitness with some key assumptions scattered throughout but lacks proximity to forecasts. Justification is weak, relying primarily on general industry trends and qualitative statements rather than quantified benchmarks or multi-year historical analysis. Specificity is partial - revenue growth rates and margin expansion expectations are mentioned but lack precise drivers, timeframes, and quantitative ranges. Internal consistency appears clean with no major contradictions between narrative and financial tables. However, the report completely lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like revenue growth, margin expansion, or WACC assumptions. While the DCF model shows specific parameters (WACC 8.1%, terminal growth 4.0%), these critical valuation inputs receive minimal justification in the narrative text.",
