    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal reasoning and explicit assumptions. The analyst provides strong mechanisms linking business drivers to outcomes, such as \"stress capital buffers decline by about 40 basis points\" and \"ROE expansion to roughly 14% over the long term.\" Explicit assumptions are well-benchmarked, including \"9.5% cost of equity\" and \"30% compensation ratio\" targets. The report shows good quantification with specific forecasts like \"3.5% annual growth in post-provision net revenue\" and \"490 basis points of margin expansion between 2024 and 2034.\" However, while the report mentions various risk scenarios in the uncertainty section and provides bull/bear cases, it lacks comprehensive quantified sensitivity analysis or multiple scenario modeling with specific impact ranges that would elevate it to excellent.",
