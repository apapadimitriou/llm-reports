    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Arista Networks report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language and well-structured sections that reinforce each other effectively. The narrative flows logically from the business overview through competitive positioning, economic moat analysis, and valuation methodology. Key terminology like EOS (Extensible Operating System), high-speed switching, and AI networking is consistently used throughout. The analyst successfully connects Arista's software-led approach to its competitive advantages, market share gains, and financial projections. Bulls/Bears points align well with the base-case narrative around AI growth opportunities and enterprise expansion challenges. The financial tables support the narrative forecasts, showing consistent growth assumptions. Temporal references are accurate, with recent analyst notes properly dated. Minor areas for improvement include some transitions between sections that could be more explicit, and the DeepSeek discussion could better connect to Arista-specific implications. Overall, the report reads as a cohesive investment argument with strong internal consistency.",
