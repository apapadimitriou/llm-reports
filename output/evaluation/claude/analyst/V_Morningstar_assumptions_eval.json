    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are explicitly stated and proximal to forecasts, with clear specificity including units, timeframes, and drivers. Revenue growth projections of 10% gross and 9% net are well-justified by historical trends and secular shifts toward electronic payments. Operating margin assumptions (48% to 49% on gross revenue basis) are supported by business scalability arguments. The 9% cost of equity and terminal growth assumptions are clearly stated. However, the report is capped at Fair due to the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for any material drivers. While qualitative risks are discussed (regulatory, macroeconomic, competitive), no quantified ranges or impact assessments are provided for key variables like growth rates, margins, or cost of capital. Internal consistency is maintained throughout with no contradictions between narrative and financial projections.",
