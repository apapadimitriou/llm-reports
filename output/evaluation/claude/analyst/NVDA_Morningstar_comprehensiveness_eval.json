    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive NVIDIA equity research report covers all major sections expected for equity research with appropriate depth. It includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit DCF modeling, risk analysis, and capital allocation review. The report provides extensive financial forecasts with sector-appropriate KPIs including revenue growth, operating margins, ROIC, and GPU-specific metrics. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (data center revenue growth, gross margins, China market dynamics) to the $170 fair value estimate through detailed DCF analysis. While peer benchmarking is present through competitor comparison tables, the report lacks formal scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case projections, preventing an Excellent rating.",
