    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This CME Group equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and logical flow throughout most sections. The narrative arc progresses smoothly from recent quarterly results through business strategy, valuation methodology, and risk assessment. Key terminology is used consistently, and sections effectively cross-reference each other, particularly between the Bulls/Bears analysis and the base-case outlook regarding interest rate volatility benefits. The analyst maintains consistent messaging about CME's dependence on market volatility rather than directionality, and this theme connects well across sections. The valuation assumptions align properly with the narrative expectations of normalized growth, and the financial tables support the textual analysis without contradictions. Temporal references are accurate, with recent events like Q1 2025 results properly contextualized. While there are minor rough edges in some transitions between subsections and the Economic Moat section could better integrate with the main valuation discussion, these issues don't materially detract from the report's overall coherence and readability.",
    "evidence": [
        "Strong cross-referencing between sections, such as Bulls/Bears mentioning 'CME stands to be a beneficiary of uncertainty around interest rates' which directly aligns with Strategy section's discussion of recent volatility tailwinds",
        "Consistent terminology usage throughout, with 'average rate per contract' and volume metrics used precisely across Analyst Note and historical earnings discussions",
        "Temporal accuracy maintained with 'Q1 2025 results' properly referenced as recent in April 2025 report date context"
