    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal explanations and explicit, quantified assumptions. The analyst provides excellent causal reasoning throughout, such as \"vomiting rates down, but they are still roughly 20%-25%\" for maritide tolerability, \"We assume a 60% probability of maritide's approval\" with \"probability-adjusted sales of $8 billion in 2033\", and \"We assume a 7% cost of capital\" with detailed WACC components. The valuation methodology includes benchmarked assumptions like \"16% tax rate for Amgen beyond 2024\" and \"5.8% pretax cost of debt\". The report addresses counterpoints including \"biosimilar competition beginning in 2025\" and \"Prolia/Xgeva biosimilars\" pressure. However, while the report mentions various scenarios and risks, it lacks comprehensive quantified sensitivity analysis or multiple detailed scenario modeling that would elevate it to excellent. The implications are actionable with specific peak sales forecasts and timeline projections.",
