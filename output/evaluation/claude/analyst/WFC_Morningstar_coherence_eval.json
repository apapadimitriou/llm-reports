    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Wells Fargo equity research report demonstrates strong coherence with clear language and logical flow throughout its sections. The narrative arc progresses smoothly from the stress test announcement through business strategy, valuation, and risks. Key terms like NII, NIM, ROTE, and asset cap are used consistently across sections. The analyst note connects well to the broader strategic outlook, with the asset cap removal theme reinforcing the Bulls case about balance sheet growth potential. The Economic Moat section provides extensive analysis that aligns with the wide moat rating, while the Fair Value section explicitly references the asset cap removal mentioned in earlier sections. The Bears case appropriately balances the Bulls arguments, noting asset sensitivity and NIM compression risks that align with the valuation discussion. Financial projections in the tables are consistent with narrative assumptions about NII growth and efficiency improvements. Temporal references are accurate, with the June 2025 asset cap removal properly characterized as recent. Minor areas for improvement include some dense technical passages in the moat analysis that could benefit from smoother transitions, but overall the report reads as a cohesive investment argument.",
    "evidence": [
        "Asset cap removal theme connects analyst note to strategy section: 'The asset cap was lifted in June 2025' flows into 'Wells can materially increase its balance sheet growth'",
        "Bears case properly reconciles with base case: 'asset-sensitive balance sheet and falling interest rates can result in net interest margin contraction' aligns with NIM compression projections",
        "Financial tables consistent with narrative: projected NII growth of 1% in 2025 matches text discussion of 'NII growth of about 1% in 2025'"
