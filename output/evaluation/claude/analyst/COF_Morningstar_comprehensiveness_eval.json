    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Capital One equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across all major sections expected for banking sector analysis. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation drivers, risk analysis, capital allocation, and extensive financial snapshots with multi-year forecasts. Key banking sector KPIs are present including net interest margin, efficiency ratio, provision ratios, ROE, ROTE, and capital ratios. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (NIM, loan growth, credit costs, efficiency improvements) to the $187 fair value estimate. Peer benchmarking is included with American Express and Synchrony Financial comparisons. Sources appear consistently cited throughout with specific dates and analyst attributions. The report avoids significant redundancy and provides proportional depth across sections. However, while comprehensive, it lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case DCF model, preventing an 'Excellent' rating.",
