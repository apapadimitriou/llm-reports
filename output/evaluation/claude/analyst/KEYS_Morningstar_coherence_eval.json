    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Keysight Technologies equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and well-structured sections that reinforce each other effectively. The narrative flows smoothly from the recent earnings update through business strategy, competitive positioning, and valuation methodology. Key terms like 'wide economic moat,' 'communications testing,' and 'PathWave platform' are used consistently throughout. The analyst successfully connects current performance metrics (7% revenue growth, positive orders) to longer-term strategic positioning in 5G and AI markets. Cross-references between sections work well, such as linking the Bulls/Bears analysis to the base-case growth assumptions and moat discussion. The extensive Economic Moat section provides detailed support for the wide moat rating through specific examples like the NTT Docomo case study. Financial projections in the valuation tables align with narrative expectations of recovery growth. Temporal references are accurate, with recent earnings properly dated to May 2025. Minor rough edges include some dense technical passages and the abrupt transition from the main analysis to the detailed financial tables, but these don't materially detract from the report's coherent investment thesis.",
    "evidence": [
        "Strong cross-referencing between moat analysis and growth projections: 'We forecast market share gains for Keysight and think greater complexity in 5G and AI networks will expand its wallet share' (Business Strategy) connects directly to detailed moat discussion",
        "Consistent terminology usage throughout: 'PathWave platform,' 'communications testing,' and 'wide economic moat' used precisely across all sections",
        "Clear temporal accuracy: Recent earnings dated 'May 2025' with proper context of 'After a 9% revenue decline in fiscal 2024, we believe the firm is back to healthy and durable levels of growth' (Analyst Note)"
