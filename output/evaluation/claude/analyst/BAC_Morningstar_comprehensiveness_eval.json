    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Bank of America report covers all major sections expected for equity research with strong sector-appropriate content. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, extensive economic moat discussion, valuation analysis, risk assessment, capital allocation review, and robust financial forecasts. Key banking KPIs are present including NIM, efficiency ratios, ROTE, and provision ratios. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (NII growth, expense control, credit costs) to fair value assumptions. Peer benchmarking is included with detailed competitor analysis. The report demonstrates consistent sourcing and minimal redundancy across sections. While scenario analysis could be more explicit, the stress test discussion and various economic scenarios provide adequate sensitivity context.",
