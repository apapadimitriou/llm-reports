    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Capital One report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and logical flow throughout most sections. The narrative arc moves smoothly from stress test analysis through business strategy, competitive positioning, and valuation assumptions. Key terms like efficiency ratio, ROTE, and credit metrics are used consistently across sections. The Bulls/Bears section effectively balances growth potential against credit risk concerns, aligning well with the base-case narrative about elevated but stabilizing credit costs. The Economic Moat section provides detailed analysis that supports the valuation assumptions about operational efficiency and scale advantages. Financial projections in the valuation tables align with narrative expectations for loan growth, margin trends, and credit normalization. Temporal references are accurate, with recent events like the Discover acquisition completion properly contextualized. The report maintains internal consistency between assumptions about credit card growth, marketing spending, and efficiency ratios across sections.",
    "evidence": [
        "Bulls/Bears section aligns with base case: Bulls cite 'solid growth despite high interest rates' while Bears note 'significant subprime lending exposure in a period of high credit costs,' matching the narrative's balanced view of credit normalization",
        "Valuation assumptions consistent with strategy: Fair Value section projects 5.8% annual credit card growth and 56% efficiency ratio, directly supporting the Business Strategy discussion of aggressive marketing and operational efficiency",
        "Economic Moat analysis reinforces financial projections: Detailed efficiency ratio analysis (averaging below 55% since 2012) supports the valuation table's efficiency ratio forecasts of 56.0-56.3%"
