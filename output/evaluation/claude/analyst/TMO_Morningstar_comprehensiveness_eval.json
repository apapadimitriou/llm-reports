    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Thermo Fisher Scientific equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across most expected sections. The report includes all major components: analyst note/executive summary, detailed business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears analysis, comprehensive economic moat assessment, valuation with profit drivers, risk analysis, capital allocation evaluation, and extensive financials with multi-year forecasts. The peer comparison table provides competitive context with key metrics. The report excels in linking valuation assumptions to operating drivers through explicit DCF methodology and includes appropriate sector KPIs like organic growth rates, ROIC, and margin analysis. Evidence citations are consistent throughout with dated analyst notes and clear sourcing. However, the report lacks formal scenario/sensitivity analysis and stress testing, which prevents an 'Excellent' rating despite the otherwise thorough coverage.",
