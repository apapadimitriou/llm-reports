    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go well beyond generic industry commentary. The analyst provides quantified projections linking GLP-1 market dynamics to specific financial outcomes ($80 billion Lilly market capture from $200+ billion total market by 2031, with net prices declining from $7,000 to $3,000 annually). The integration of competitive positioning analysis (60% Zepbound prescription share gains vs Novo Nordisk), pipeline differentiation (orforglipron's manufacturing advantages and $20 billion sales potential), and policy risk quantification (24% revenue hit scenario from price benchmarking) represents sophisticated synthesis work. The margin expansion thesis connecting high-margin drug launches to operating leverage (low-30s to mid-40s operating margins) provides actionable investment insight with clear catalysts and timelines.",
