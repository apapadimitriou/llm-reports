    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms and explicit, benchmarked assumptions throughout. The analyst provides excellent causal explanations such as \"driven by nominal GDP growth and pricing\" for ratings revenue and \"30-65 basis points in savings\" from bond ratings. Key assumptions are well-quantified and benchmarked, including \"52% adjusted operating margins in 2029\" versus \"49% in 2024\" and pricing power \"typically around 3%-4% per year.\" The DCF model includes explicit parameters like \"WACC 7.3%\" and detailed financial projections. However, while the report mentions potential risks like \"slowing global economy\" and acknowledges market sensitivity, it lacks comprehensive scenario analysis with quantified sensitivities (e.g., \"what if bond issuance drops 20%?\"). The actionable implications are clear, with the analyst maintaining the \"$540 fair value estimate\" and providing specific investment guidance based on comprehensive moat analysis.",
