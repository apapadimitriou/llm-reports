    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This American Express equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language and well-structured analysis. The report flows logically from the analyst note through business strategy, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation, and risk sections. Each section reinforces the others effectively, with consistent terminology usage throughout. The narrative aligns well with the detailed financial tables and projections. The bulls and bears arguments are properly reconciled with the base-case valuation narrative, showing how competitive advantages support the wide moat rating while acknowledging overvaluation concerns. Temporal references are accurate, with the June 2025 stress test results appropriately described as recent. The extensive analyst notes archive provides valuable context and demonstrates consistent analytical approach over time. Minor areas for improvement include some transitions between subsections within the economic moat section, but these do not materially detract from the report's overall coherence and readability.",
    "evidence": [
        "Bulls/Bears section properly reconciles with base-case narrative - bulls highlight closed-loop network advantages and NII growth that support wide moat rating, while bears acknowledge economic sensitivity that aligns with risk assessment",
        "Strong cross-referencing between sections - Economic Moat section's discussion of closed-loop network advantages directly supports Business Strategy section's revenue mix analysis (75% noninterest income)",
        "Financial projections in valuation tables align with narrative expectations - NII growth deceleration from 32.7% (2023) to 8.4% (2025) matches Strategy section's discussion of growth normalization"
