    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong originality through multiple company-specific syntheses that go beyond generic banking analysis. Key original insights include: (1) quantifying Wells Fargo's unique asset-sensitive balance sheet impact on NIM compression (2.70% in 2025 vs 2.74% in 2024), (2) linking asset cap removal to specific efficiency improvements and balance sheet growth potential, (3) synthesizing stress test results with Wells' specific capital position to project 1.2-1.5 percentage point stress capital buffer reductions, and (4) connecting deposit franchise advantages to concrete funding metrics (80% deposit funding vs 65% for larger rivals). The analysis provides decision-relevant mechanisms with specific numbers, catalysts, and timelines. While some sections contain standard banking commentary, the core insights are distinctly Wells Fargo-specific and actionable for investment decisions.",
