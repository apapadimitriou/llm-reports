{
    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid assumption quality across most pillars. Key assumptions are explicitly stated and proximal to forecasts, including specific growth rates (net revenue CAGR >2.5%, AUM growth 6%-8%, investment banking 2.5% CAGR, NII 8% CAGR), operating margins (~26%), leverage ratios (12-13x), and cost of equity (9%). Most assumptions are well-justified with historical context, peer comparisons, and management targets. The report provides comprehensive specificity with clear units, timeframes, and drivers. Internal consistency is maintained throughout with no contradictions identified. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers, which caps the grade at Good despite otherwise strong assumption quality.",
