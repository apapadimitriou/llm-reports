    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This CrowdStrike equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across all major sections expected for cybersecurity software analysis. The report includes detailed coverage of business strategy, competitive positioning, economic moat analysis, and comprehensive financial projections through 2030. Key software industry KPIs are well-represented, including ARR ($4.018 billion), net retention rates (115%), gross retention (95%+), and revenue growth metrics. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers like land-and-expand strategy and upselling velocity to the $330 fair value estimate through a detailed DCF model. Evidence integration is consistent throughout with proper sourcing. The report includes robust peer comparison with Microsoft, Fortinet, and Palo Alto Networks, though it lacks formal scenario analysis or sensitivity testing that would elevate it to excellent.",
