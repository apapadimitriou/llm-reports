    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong synthesis capabilities through multiple company-specific analyses. Key syntheses include: linking stress test results to specific capital buffer reductions and excess capital quantification (5% of market cap); connecting BBVA acquisition integration with efficiency improvements and branch expansion strategy; synthesizing duration risk management with NII projections in rate environment; and combining tariff uncertainty with credit cost expectations. The valuation section provides novel drivers including specific NII growth projections (7% in 2025), efficiency ratio targets (58%), and normalized ROTE expectations (16.5%). While some content covers standard banking topics, the report provides substantial company-specific insights with quantified mechanisms and clear catalysts, making it decision-relevant for investors.",
