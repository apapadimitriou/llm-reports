    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates good quality assumptions with explicit statements of key drivers and specific magnitudes. Revenue assumptions are clearly stated with specific decline rates (MS drugs declining 10% annually, Leqembi peak sales of $3 billion, Spinraza at $1.5 billion). The WACC of 7.1% is explicitly stated. Justification is solid, drawing on historical performance, competitive dynamics, and regulatory approvals. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario ranges for material drivers like Leqembi sales ramp, MS decline rates, or WACC variations. While risks are discussed qualitatively, no numerical ranges are provided. The assumptions are internally consistent and reconcile well across sections, supporting the revenue forecasts and valuation model.",
