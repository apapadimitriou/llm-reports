    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Morningstar equity research report covers all major expected sections with strong depth and sector-appropriate analysis. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit DCF methodology, risk analysis, capital allocation discussion, and extensive financial forecasts. Healthcare-specific considerations are well-integrated throughout, including Medicare Advantage dynamics, regulatory risks, and PBM operations. The valuation section clearly links operating drivers (revenue growth, margin assumptions, regulatory impacts) to the $473 fair value estimate through detailed DCF analysis. Peer benchmarking is present with competitor comparisons. The main limitation is the absence of formal scenario/sensitivity analysis beyond the base case DCF model, which prevents an Excellent rating.",
