    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This comprehensive Labcorp equity research report demonstrates strong coverage across all major sections with appropriate depth for the diagnostics industry. The report includes robust financial analysis with multi-year forecasts, sector-appropriate KPIs (revenue growth, operating margins, price per requisition growth, test volumes), and consistent sourcing throughout. The valuation section effectively links operating drivers like medical utilization trends and acquisition impacts to the $260 fair value estimate through detailed DCF modeling. Competitive positioning is well-addressed with peer comparisons to Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare. The capital allocation analysis is particularly thorough, earning an 'Exemplary' rating. While the report covers ESG considerations and includes extensive historical analysis through archived analyst notes, it lacks explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis and stress testing that would elevate it to 'Excellent'. The integration of recent acquisitions, PAMA regulatory impacts, and industry dynamics shows strong analytical depth with minimal redundancy across sections.",
