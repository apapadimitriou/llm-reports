    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This Johnson & Johnson equity research report demonstrates strong overall coherence with clear language, logical section organization, and consistent terminology throughout. The narrative flows well from the analyst note discussing regulatory risks through business strategy, valuation drivers, and risk assessment. Cross-references between sections are evident, such as the connection between patent pressures mentioned in Bulls/Bears and the specific drug pipeline discussions in Fair Value. The financial tables align well with the narrative assumptions, particularly regarding growth expectations and margin forecasts. Temporal references are accurate, with recent events like Trump's May 12 executive order properly contextualized. The Bulls/Bears section reconciles appropriately with the base-case valuation, acknowledging both pipeline strength and patent headwinds. Minor areas for improvement include some transitions that could be more explicit and occasional dense technical discussions, but these don't materially detract from the report's coherence.",
