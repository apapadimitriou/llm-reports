    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "This S&P Global equity research report demonstrates strong structural coherence and clear analytical flow. The narrative progresses logically from business overview through moat analysis to valuation, with sections reinforcing each other effectively. The Economic Moat section provides detailed justification for the wide moat rating across multiple business segments, which aligns well with the Bulls/Bears analysis and valuation assumptions. Financial projections in the valuation tables are consistent with the narrative's expectations of 6% organic growth and margin expansion to 52% by 2029. The Bulls and Bears sections are appropriately reconciled with the base-case outlook, acknowledging both the diversification benefits from IHS Markit and the cyclical nature of ratings revenue. Terminology is used consistently throughout, and temporal references align with the report dates. The analyst notes provide good connective tissue, referencing how quarterly results inform the ongoing fair value estimate. Minor areas for improvement include some transitions between business segments that could be smoother, and the mobility spinoff discussion could better integrate with the overall investment thesis.",
    "evidence": [
        "Economic Moat section provides detailed network effects analysis that directly supports the 'strong pricing power' mentioned in Bulls section and 3-4% annual pricing assumptions in valuation",
        "Bears section acknowledgment of 'slowing global economy' pressure on ratings business is reconciled with base case expectation of 'flat ratings revenue in 2025' in analyst notes",
        "Valuation assumptions of 52% operating margins by 2029 align with Business Strategy discussion of margin expansion from streamlining operations"
