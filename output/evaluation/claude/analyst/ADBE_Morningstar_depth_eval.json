    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal explanations and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. The analyst provides concrete mechanisms linking performance drivers to outcomes, such as \"digital media was strong and drove the vast majority of revenue upside\" and explains AI monetization with \"$160 million in annual recurring revenue from AI.\" Key assumptions are quantified and benchmarked, including \"five-year revenue compound annual growth rate of approximately 10%\" and valuation multiples like \"fiscal 2025 enterprise value/sales multiple of 10 times.\" The DCF model includes explicit parameters: \"Cost of Equity 9.0%\" and \"Stage II EBI Growth Rate 9.1%.\" However, while the report mentions lowering \"growth assumptions by approximately 30 basis points annually,\" it lacks comprehensive scenario analysis or sensitivity testing around key assumptions. The analyst provides some counterpoint analysis through Bulls/Bears sections and discusses risks, but doesn't offer quantified ranges for different outcomes. The implications are actionable, stating shares are \"attractive\" at current levels, but the analysis would benefit from more robust stress-testing of core assumptions.",
