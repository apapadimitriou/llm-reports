    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong analytical synthesis in several areas, particularly around the China trade policy reversal and its strategic implications. The analyst provides quantified insights linking geopolitical developments to specific revenue impacts ($1.2B in 2025, $2.8B in 2029) with clear catalysts and timelines. The synthesis of AMD's competitive positioning against Nvidia in AI markets, combined with analysis of x86 architecture advantages and TSMC partnership benefits, shows company-specific depth. The report includes decision-relevant theses about market share dynamics in both PC and AI GPU segments, supported by concrete forecasts and margin expansion targets. While some sections contain standard industry commentary, the core insights around policy reversals, competitive dynamics, and quantified growth trajectories provide substantial originality and actionability for investment decisions.",
