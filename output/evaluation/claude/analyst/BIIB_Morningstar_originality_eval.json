    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report contains primarily generic restatements and copied content with minimal original synthesis. While it provides extensive company-specific details about Biogen's drug portfolio and financial projections, most insights are straightforward restatements of public information without deeper analytical synthesis. The report covers standard topics like MS drug competition, generic pressures, and pipeline developments but lacks novel interpretive frameworks or unique causal mechanisms. The valuation section relies on standard DCF methodology without introducing innovative drivers or analytical angles. Although there are some weak syntheses around portfolio transitions and competitive dynamics, the overall analysis remains largely descriptive rather than providing distinctive investment insights that go beyond readily available information.",
