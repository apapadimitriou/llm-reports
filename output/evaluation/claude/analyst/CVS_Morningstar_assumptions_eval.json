    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates partial explicitness with key assumptions stated in the valuation section, including cost of equity (9.0%), WACC (7.8%), and terminal growth (3.0%). However, justification is weak, with most parameters lacking supporting evidence or historical context. Specificity is partial, with units and timeframes provided for some metrics but missing causal drivers for many assumptions. Internal consistency appears clean with no major contradictions identified between narrative and financial tables. The critical limitation is the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair according to the hard constraints. While the report provides comprehensive qualitative discussion of risks and business dynamics, the lack of stress-testing on key valuation inputs like WACC, terminal growth, or margin assumptions prevents a higher rating despite otherwise solid financial modeling.",
