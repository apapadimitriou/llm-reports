    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms linking policy changes to financial outcomes. The analyst provides explicit quantified assumptions including \"$5 billion of revenue to the October and January quarters\" and \"about $30 billion into fiscal 2027\" tied directly to the H20 sales reversal. The report shows solid causal reasoning with statements like \"DC revenue of $39.1 billion was up 73% year over year\" and \"massive DC growth has been gross margin-accretive.\" Key assumptions are benchmarked, such as \"WACC ~9%\" and detailed margin projections of \"71% in fiscal 2026\" declining to \"low-70% range a decade from now.\" However, while the report acknowledges uncertainty with \"Very High fair value Uncertainty Rating\" and mentions competitive threats, it lacks comprehensive scenario analysis with quantified ranges. The implications are actionable, stating shares \"appear fairly valued to us\" with specific price targets, but more extensive sensitivity testing would elevate this to excellent analytical depth.",
