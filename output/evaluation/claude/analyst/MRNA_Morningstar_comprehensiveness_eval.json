    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report demonstrates comprehensive coverage across all major sections expected for equity research. The report includes detailed analyst notes, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit DCF modeling, risk analysis, and capital allocation discussion. The financials section provides multi-year historical data and forecasts with biotech-appropriate metrics including revenue growth, operating margins, and R&D spending ratios. The valuation section effectively links operating drivers (pipeline probabilities, market sizes, margin assumptions) to the $85 fair value estimate through a three-stage DCF model. Peer benchmarking is present with competitor analysis. The report maintains consistent sourcing throughout and avoids significant redundancy. While scenario analysis could be more explicit, the probabilistic approach to pipeline valuation and uncertainty rating provide adequate sensitivity consideration.",
