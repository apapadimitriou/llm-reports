    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions show mixed quality across the five pillars. Explicitness is reasonable with key drivers like NII growth, efficiency ratios, and ROTE targets clearly stated in forecasting sections. Justification is partial, with some historical context and peer comparisons but limited multi-year benchmarking for specific parameters. Specificity is solid, providing concrete figures like 2%-3% core revenue growth, 63% efficiency ratio, and 8% ROTE with clear time horizons. Internal consistency appears clean with no obvious contradictions between narrative and financial tables. However, the critical weakness is the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers, which caps the grade at Fair despite other strengths.",
