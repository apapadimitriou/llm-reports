    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Snowflake equity research report demonstrates strong comprehensiveness across all major sections with appropriate depth and sector-specific focus. The report includes all essential components: analyst note, business description, strategy outlook, bulls/bears analysis, economic moat assessment, valuation with explicit profit drivers, risk analysis, capital allocation, and comprehensive financials. The financials section excels with multi-year historical data and forward forecasts including key SaaS metrics like revenue retention (126%), remaining performance obligations (+33% YoY), and customer growth metrics. Valuation assumptions are clearly linked to operating drivers with specific margin expansion forecasts and growth rates. Peer analysis with major competitors (Amazon, Google, Microsoft) provides valuable context. The report maintains consistent sourcing and minimal redundancy. However, it lacks scenario analysis and sensitivity testing that would elevate it to excellent status.",
