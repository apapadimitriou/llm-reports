    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates partial explicitness with key assumptions stated but scattered across sections. Several critical assumptions are provided with specific magnitudes and time horizons, including NIM compression to 2.70% in 2025, efficiency ratio targets of ~61%, and terminal ROTE of 14.3%. Justification is partial, with some historical context and peer comparisons but limited depth. The report shows solid internal consistency with no major contradictions found between narrative and financial tables. However, the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario testing for material drivers like NIM, credit costs, or efficiency ratios caps the grade at Fair per the hard cap rule. While assumptions are reasonably well-stated, the lack of stress-testing significantly limits the model's robustness.",
