    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a compilation of public information rather than an original analysis. It relies almost exclusively on data points directly extracted from Salesforce's FY25 earnings press release and Reuters news articles, such as the specific count of Agentforce deals, Data Cloud ARR growth, and the departure of the CFO. There is no evidence of synthesis where multiple data points are combined to reach a novel conclusion; instead, the report merely lists 'Bulls Say' and 'Bears Say' points that are well-documented in the public domain. The valuation section is particularly generic, utilizing standard DCF assumptions (9% WACC, 2.5% terminal growth) and revenue forecasts that mirror management's own guidance without introducing unique drivers or company-specific mechanisms. Because the report lacks any original thesis or synthesis and relies on paraphrasing cited sources for all its core insights, it fails to meet the threshold for 'Fair' and is graded 'Poor' per the decision rules.",
