    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original insights, relying almost exclusively on paraphrasing Morningstar's research and Adobe's public earnings releases. Every 'insight' presented is either a restatement of financial results (e.g., Q2 revenue, ARR growth) or a repetition of well-documented bull/bear cases (e.g., competition from Canva, AI monetization skepticism). There is no evidence of synthesis; for instance, the report mentions AI skepticism but does not provide a quantified pathway or specific monitoring signals to evaluate AI's impact on margins or retention. The valuation section is a boilerplate DCF with standard inputs (10% growth, 7.5% WACC) that lacks any company-specific novel drivers. Because the report contains zero original theses or syntheses and relies heavily on cited external analysis, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",
