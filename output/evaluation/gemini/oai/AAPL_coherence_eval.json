    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits strong structural flow and clear language, but it is fundamentally compromised by significant temporal and data contradictions that trigger mandatory hard caps. Most critically, the report is dated June 9, 2025, yet it cites multiple sources from July 2025 (Sources 4 and 7) and references specific financial impacts from those future dates as current events. This logical impossibility regarding the report's timeline constitutes a major failure in internal consistency. Additionally, there is a minor but unaddressed contradiction between the narrative and the financial tables: the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section projects FY2029 revenue at 'roughly $480 billion,' whereas the 'Financials Snapshot' table explicitly lists the estimate as $475 billion. Despite these errors, the report\u2019s narrative connectivity is impressive. The Analyst Note successfully integrates the 'Hold' recommendation by reconciling the current market price with the Fair Value Estimate. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' points are well-integrated into the broader argument, particularly regarding valuation multiples and regulatory risks. The transitions between sections\u2014such as linking the 'Wide Moat' to the 'Services' growth described in the Strategy section\u2014are smooth and logical. However, under the strict grading rubric, the presence of unaddressed contradictions between narrative and tables, combined with the impossible temporal claims, limits the final grade to 'fair' regardless of the high-quality prose and thematic coherence.",
    "evidence": [
        "The report date (June 9, 2025) is logically inconsistent with the citation of Source 4 (July 31, 2025) and Source 7 (July 18, 2025).",
        "A contradiction exists between the Fair Value narrative projecting $480 billion in 2029 revenue and the Financials Snapshot table listing $475 billion.",
        "The Analyst Note provides a clear transition from Q2 2025 performance to the 'Hold' recommendation, reconciling the $185 FVE with the $200 market price."
