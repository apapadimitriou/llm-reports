    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report initially appears professional, providing explicit assumptions for revenue growth, margins, and valuation parameters. However, it fails the consistency test due to multiple distinct numeric contradictions between the narrative and the supporting data tables. First, the WACC calculation is internally inconsistent: the report cites a 9.0% WACC but provides components (4.0% Risk-Free Rate, 5.0% Equity Risk Premium, and 1.1 Beta) that mathematically result in 9.5% using the CAPM formula. Second, there is a significant discrepancy regarding Free Cash Flow (FCF) conversion; the text specifies a model of 30\u201332% of revenue, yet the Financials Snapshot for FY2029 shows $17.0B FCF on $50.0B revenue, representing a 34% conversion rate. Third, the operating margin forecast in the table (35.5% by FY2029) exceeds the stated range of 34\u201335% in the narrative. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis is insufficient. While it provides a brief \"rule of thumb\" regarding the impact of a 1% change in revenue or margins, it lacks quantified ranges, scenario tables, or Bull/Bear price targets for material drivers like WACC or terminal growth. Per the grading instructions, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions necessitates a \"Poor\" grade. The lack of internal coherence suggests the model outputs and the narrative were not properly reconciled, rendering the assumptions unreliable for an auditable valuation.",
