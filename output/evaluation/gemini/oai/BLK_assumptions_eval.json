    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s quality of assumptions is graded Poor due to significant internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key drivers such as revenue CAGR (~6%) and operating margins, these figures are undermined by discrepancies between the narrative and the data tables. Specifically, the narrative cites a 2% risk-free rate and 6% equity risk premium to reach an 8% WACC, whereas the Appendix table lists a 4% risk-free rate and 5% equity risk premium for the same 8% WACC. Furthermore, the narrative projects operating margins expanding toward 46%, while the financial snapshot and appendix explicitly model 47% by 2029. Most critically, the report fails the hard cap for sensitivity analysis; although it identifies macro risks like market volatility and interest rate shifts, it provides no quantified impact on valuation or earnings (e.g., no bull/bear cases or delta tables). This 'black-box' approach to the final valuation, combined with unreconciled numeric inputs, prevents the assumptions from being auditable or reliable.",
