    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions primarily as a news aggregator rather than an original piece of equity research. Every significant analytical point\u2014including the lifting of the $1.95 trillion asset cap, the 24% jump in investment banking fees, and the $40 billion buyback program\u2014is directly cited from Reuters or other public news outlets. There is no evidence of independent data synthesis; for example, the report mentions net interest income (NII) pressure but relies entirely on management guidance and news summaries rather than providing an original analysis of deposit betas or balance sheet repricing. The valuation section is particularly weak in originality, utilizing boilerplate DCF assumptions (2% terminal growth, 9-10% WACC) and deferring to Bloomberg consensus for EPS growth rates rather than deriving a unique forecast. Because the report lacks any original thesis, quantified causal mechanisms, or interpretive commentary that goes beyond paraphrasing public sources, it fails to meet the threshold for a 'Fair' grade under the provided decision rules.",
