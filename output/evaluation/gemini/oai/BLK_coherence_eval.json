    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of narrative coherence, effectively linking BlackRock\u2019s record Q2 2025 AUM of $12.53 trillion to its broader strategic pivot toward high-margin alternatives and technology services. The Analyst Note provides a clear bridge between recent financial performance\u2014such as the 26% jump in tech revenue\u2014and the long-term goal of reaching a 30% revenue mix from these segments by 2030. Transitions between sections are generally smooth, with the Business Strategy section reinforcing the rationale behind recent multi-billion dollar acquisitions like GIP and Preqin.\n\nHowever, the report suffers from significant internal contradictions regarding its quantitative valuation framework. In the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section, the author assumes a 2% risk-free rate and a 6% equity risk premium to arrive at an 8% WACC. Conversely, the Appendix table lists a 4% risk-free rate and a 5% equity risk premium, resulting in a 9% Cost of Equity. This discrepancy in fundamental discount rate inputs creates an unresolved tension in the valuation argument. Furthermore, the narrative describes operating margins expanding 'towards ~46%,' yet the Financials Snapshot and Appendix both explicitly forecast a 47% margin by 2029. While the qualitative analysis is highly polished, these mathematical inconsistencies between the narrative and the supporting tables necessitate a hard cap at 'fair' per the grading instructions.",

        "Narrative cites '2% risk-free, 6% equity premium' for an 8% WACC, while Appendix lists 'Risk-free Rate ~4.0%' and 'Equity Risk Premium ~5.0%' for a 9% Ke (Fair Value vs Appendix).",
        "Fair Value narrative projects margins 'towards ~46%,' but the Financials Snapshot table shows 47.0% for FY2029.",
        "Analyst Note links Q2 2025 tech revenue growth (26%) to offsetting performance fee declines (-43%), showing strong local flow."
