    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions primarily as a summary of public information rather than an original piece of equity research. It heavily relies on recent SEC filings and news reports (Reuters) to describe the Q1 2025 earnings beat and the announced Mobility spin-off. There is no evidence of synthesis; for example, the valuation section adopts management's 4\u20136% revenue guidance as its primary driver for a 5\u20136% CAGR without providing an independent or novel mechanism for growth. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' and 'Economic Moat' sections utilize boilerplate language regarding 'brand reputation' and 'network effects' that could apply to any major financial data provider. No original thesis is presented; the report concludes that the stock is 'somewhat undervalued' based on a standard DCF that lacks unique inputs or peer-relative catalysts. Because the report fails to link disparate data points into new conclusions and offers zero decision-relevant insights beyond what is available in public headlines, it is classified as Poor.",
