    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required sections and maintains consistent, high-quality sourcing with explicit links to SEC filings and news reports. The valuation section successfully bridges operating drivers (revenue CAGR, EBIT margins) to the fair value estimate of $620. However, the report fails to achieve a higher rating due to two critical flaws. First, the Financials Snapshot table is generic, providing only standard metrics like Revenue and EPS while omitting essential sector-specific KPIs such as Recurring Revenue percentage, Retention/Renewal rates, Billed Issuance Volumes for the Ratings segment, and Index-linked Assets Under Management (AUM). Per the grading instructions, the omission of two or more core sector KPIs in the snapshot triggers a hard cap of 'Fair.' Second, the report exhibits significant superficial redundancy. Key talking points\u2014specifically the 2025 revenue growth guidance of 4\u20136%, the 85% free-cash-flow return target, and the Carfax mobility spin-off\u2014are repeated across five different sections (Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy, Bulls Say, and Capital Allocation) with virtually no additional depth or unique analysis in subsequent mentions. According to the decision rules, repeating the same talking point across two or more sections without new depth requires a one-level downgrade. Consequently, the grade is lowered from the 'Fair' cap to 'Poor.' The lack of scenario or sensitivity analysis further limits the report's comprehensiveness.",
