    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple material internal contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key assumptions such as a 4% Revenue CAGR, 8% WACC, and 32% average operating margin in its appendix, these figures fail the consistency test. Specifically, the narrative forecasts FY2029 revenue at $480 billion, whereas the financial snapshot table lists it as $475 billion. Furthermore, the narrative repeatedly characterizes Services growth as 'double-digit' (12\u201313%), yet the valuation appendix justifies the model using 'high-single-digit' Services growth. These discrepancies suggest the narrative and the financial model are not fully reconciled. Additionally, the report fails the sensitivity requirement; it offers no quantified ranges or scenario tables (e.g., Bull/Bear cases) for material drivers like WACC or revenue growth. The only attempt at sensitivity is a qualitative mention of a potential 2% EPS impact from regulatory changes, which is insufficient for a 'Good' or 'Fair' rating under the provided rubric. Per the hard caps, the combination of two distinct numeric contradictions and the lack of systematic sensitivity analysis mandates a Poor grade.",
