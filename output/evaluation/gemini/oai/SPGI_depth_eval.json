    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a clear descriptive overview with several explicit causal mechanisms, such as noting that \"high operating leverage and cost discipline yield expanding operating margins\" and linking revenue growth to \"secular demand for data and analytics.\" It lists specific valuation assumptions, including a \"WACC of ~8%,\" a \"terminal EBITDA multiple ~18\u00d7,\" and a \"revenue CAGR ~5\u20136%.\" Some of these are benchmarked, for instance, aligning revenue forecasts with \"2025 guidance of 4\u20136%\" and noting the \"implied EV/EBITDA is below historical peaks.\" However, the report fails to meet the criteria for a higher grade because it lacks any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. While it identifies significant risks\u2014such as how a \"severe downturn... could sharply reduce debt issuance\" or the potential for \"antitrust probes\"\u2014it does not quantify the impact of these events on the fair value estimate or EPS. The implications are actionable but remain generic without conditional, data-driven ranges to guide investor decisions under uncertainty.",
