    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded 'poor' due to significant internal contradictions and a failure to reconcile conflicting valuation data. The most glaring issue is the discrepancy between the report's stated Fair Value Estimate of $430 (Cover and Fair Value sections) and the 'Bulls Say' section, which cites a Morningstar valuation of $590 as a key driver for upside. This $160 difference is never addressed, leaving the reader to guess which target the analyst actually supports. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in data points, such as the Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) being cited as $19.96 billion in the Business Description but $19.7 billion in the Economic Moat section. While the narrative flow within sections is generally clear, the report suffers from list-like structures in the Bulls/Bears and Risk sections, which lack the connective tissue required for a higher rating. The failure to reconcile the aggressive share buyback activity\u201415.6 million shares in the first half of FY2025 alone\u2014with the 'modest' decline assumed in the valuation model further undermines the report's coherence. Per the grading guardrails, the unaddressed contradictions cap the grade at 'fair,' and the failure to reconcile the Bulls/Bears narrative with the base-case valuation necessitates a further downgrade to 'poor.'",
