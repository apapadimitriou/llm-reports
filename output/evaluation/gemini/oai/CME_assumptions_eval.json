    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s quality of assumptions is rated Poor due to a combination of internal numeric contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is explicit in stating its primary drivers\u2014such as a 5\u20137% revenue CAGR, a 60% operating margin, and an 8.5% WACC\u2014it fails to maintain internal consistency. Specifically, the 'Business Strategy & Outlook' section forecasts 'mid-60s percentage operating margins,' which directly contradicts the 'Financials Snapshot' table and the 'Fair Value' section, both of which model margins declining from 60% to 58% through 2029. This discrepancy suggests a lack of coordination between the narrative and the underlying model. Furthermore, the report violates a hard cap by failing to provide any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. Although it qualitatively identifies material risks like competition from FMX and interest rate volatility, it does not provide ranges or valuation impacts for these drivers, leaving the $250 fair-value estimate as a 'black-box' output. Justification is only partial; while it cites historical fee rates ($0.682) and ROIC (14\u201315%), it provides no derivation for the 8.5% WACC or the specific 3% terminal growth rate. The presence of a material contradiction alongside the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade under the defined evaluation rules.",
