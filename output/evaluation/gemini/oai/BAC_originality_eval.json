    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a competent summary of Bank of America\u2019s current financial standing but lacks original, proprietary insights. It relies heavily on paraphrasing public news sources (CNBC, Reuters) and existing research (Morningstar). Specifically, the net interest income (NII) growth forecasts of 6\u20137% and the 'Wide Moat' designation are direct restatements of management guidance and Morningstar\u2019s recent upgrade, respectively. The report identifies one weak synthesis regarding the bank's 'balance sheet repositioning' and its effect on yield calibration, but this is largely a reflection of management's own 'Responsible Growth' narrative rather than a unique analytical conclusion. The valuation section utilizes a standard DCF model with generic inputs (mid-single-digit revenue growth, 9% WACC) and lacks any novel company-specific drivers or mechanisms. Because more than three insights are restatements of public headlines and the valuation lacks a novel driver, the report is capped at the 'Fair' grade per the instruction's hard caps.",
