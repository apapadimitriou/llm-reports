    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded poor due to multiple severe internal contradictions and temporal inaccuracies that compromise the integrity of the investment argument. The most significant failure is the disconnect between the narrative and the financial data regarding profitability. Both the 'Business Strategy & Outlook' and 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' sections explicitly forecast operating margins in the 'mid-20% range' or 'roughly 25%.' However, the 'Financials Snapshot' table presents a conflicting set of data, showing a 2024 actual margin of 16.2% and forecasting 2025\u20132029 margins between 14.0% and 18.0%. This massive discrepancy is never addressed or reconciled.\n\nFurthermore, the report contains a blatant temporal error in the ESG Risk section, which references data 'as of Oct 2025,' despite the report being dated August 1, 2025. There is also a logical breakdown in the revenue geography; the 'Business Description' claims the U.S. is one of the largest markets but then states that 76% of revenue is from non-U.S. markets, which is mathematically inconsistent. Finally, the EPS projections in the table show a jump from $2.39 to $12.00 (a 400% increase) on only 6.6% revenue growth and declining margins. While the narrative mentions 'adjusted EPS,' it fails to explain the massive bridge required to reach these figures from the reported 2024 baseline, leaving the reader to guess at the underlying assumptions.",
