    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is downgraded to 'fair' primarily due to a significant internal contradiction between the strategic narrative and the financial model. The 'Business Strategy & Outlook' section explicitly forecasts 'mid-60s percentage operating margins' as technology investments level off. However, the 'Financials Snapshot' table presents a conflicting trend, showing operating margins steadily declining from 61.0% in 2023 to 58.0% by 2029. This unresolved tension between the qualitative claims and the quantitative data violates the core requirement for internal consistency.\n\nAdditionally, there is a disconnect in growth assumptions. The 'Business Strategy & Outlook' anticipates 'low-single-digit volume growth,' yet the 'Analyst Note' and 'Fair Value' sections project a 5\u20137% revenue CAGR. Given that the 'Fair Value' section assumes per-contract fee rates remain 'stable,' the 6.5% revenue CAGR implied by the table (growing from $6.2B in 2024 to $8.5B in 2029) cannot be reconciled with 'low-single-digit' (typically 1\u20133%) volume growth. \n\nFinally, the report exhibits temporal weaknesses by relying on outdated citations to support current ratings. It uses a 2017 Morningstar stewardship rating and a 2019 SEC filing to justify its 2025 conclusions. While the report successfully integrates Q1 2025 earnings data and the recent OSTTRA sale, these strengths are undermined by the failure to align the long-term financial model with the narrative. Because of the unaddressed contradiction between the margin narrative and the table, a hard cap of 'fair' is applied.",
