    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates 'Good' analytical depth by providing a structured valuation framework with clear causal mechanisms. It explains margin expansion through the lens of operating leverage, noting 'sales growth outpaces SG&A and R&D' and 'operating efficiency initiatives have lifted non-GAAP operating margin.' Forecasts are tied to explicit drivers like 'cross-cloud adoption and new AI feature upsells.' The report includes quantified, explicit assumptions such as 'WACC ~10.0% (Cost of equity ~30%)' and 'no terminal growth beyond 2029.' It addresses uncertainty through a quantified sensitivity analysis, stating a '1% change in WACC swings PV by ~10%.' While it benchmarks valuation multiples and ESG risks against peers, it lacks comprehensive scenario analysis (e.g., Bull/Bear financial cases) or a range for the Fair Value estimate. The implications are actionable, providing a clear Fair Value of $300 against the current price, but the depth of benchmarking for the 20% long-term margin target is limited, preventing an 'Excellent' grade.",
