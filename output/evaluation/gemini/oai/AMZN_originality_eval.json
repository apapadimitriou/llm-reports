    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits a total lack of originality, functioning almost entirely as a summary of Morningstar\u2019s existing research and public company filings. Every critical analytical pillar\u2014including the $240 Fair Value Estimate, the 'Wide' Economic Moat rating, the 'Exemplary' Capital Allocation rating, and the specific operating margin expansion forecasts\u2014is explicitly attributed to Morningstar. The author provides no independent synthesis; instead, they aggregate well-known data points (e.g., 61% third-party unit sales, AWS 17% growth) and standard news headlines (e.g., FTC antitrust lawsuit, Temu competition) without adding any unique interpretive commentary or proprietary angles. The valuation section is particularly derivative, utilizing a standard DCF framework with growth and margin assumptions directly lifted from the cited Morningstar analyst notes. Because the report contains zero original theses or syntheses and relies on paraphrasing a single primary source for its decision-relevant conclusions, it fails to meet the threshold for a 'Fair' grade.",
