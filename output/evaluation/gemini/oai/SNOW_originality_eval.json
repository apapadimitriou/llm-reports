    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a summary of existing public information and third-party analysis rather than providing original insights. It relies heavily on external sources (Morningstar for moat/uncertainty, TipRanks for capital allocation, and SEC filings for financials) without synthesizing these data points into a new or unique conclusion. Every 'insight' identified is either a restatement of earnings results, a repetition of company marketing regarding multi-cloud benefits, or a generic projection of operating leverage common to the SaaS sector. There is no original thesis or specific, testable mechanism presented that isn't already a standard part of the market consensus. The valuation section uses a standard DCF with boilerplate drivers (revenue growth and margin expansion) and lacks any novel driver or company-specific catalyst. Consequently, the report fails to meet the minimum threshold for 'Fair' due to the total absence of synthesis or original thesis.",
