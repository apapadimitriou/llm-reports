    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is assigned a grade of fair due to significant internal contradictions and a temporal impossibility that undermines its structural coherence. The most prominent issue is the inconsistent reporting of 2025 capital expenditure. The Analyst Note explicitly cites a '$75 billion 2025 capital expenditure plan,' whereas the Bears Say, Capital Allocation, and Appendix sections all state the figure is '$85 billion+' or 'peaking at $85 billion.' This $10 billion discrepancy is a material contradiction regarding the company's primary investment focus. Furthermore, the report contains a temporal error: it is dated June 7, 2025, yet the Financials Snapshot and Sources section cite a GuruFocus data point from July 27, 2025. Citing a source from the future relative to the report date is a major logical failure. Additionally, there are inconsistencies regarding the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which is described as 'around 9%' in the Fair Value section but specified as '9.6%' in the Financials Snapshot. While the narrative flow is generally smooth and the Bulls/Bears sections are successfully reconciled with the base-case valuation\u2014arguing that AI investments reinforce the moat\u2014these quantitative and temporal errors trigger the mandatory 'fair' cap under the grading guardrails. The report provides a clear structure, but the lack of precision in key financial assumptions and dates prevents a higher rating.",
