    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is well-structured and features exceptional sourcing with consistent in-text citations. However, it is graded 'Fair' due to several critical omissions and structural issues. Most significantly, the Financials Snapshot is generic and fails to include at least two core sector-specific KPIs: R&D expenditure and specific revenue forecasts for the company's primary growth drivers, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Per the grading rules, the omission of these core KPIs in the snapshot table caps the grade at 'Fair.' Additionally, while the report provides industry and regulatory context, it lacks a formal peer benchmarking analysis or comparison table, which is expected for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating. The report also suffers from significant redundancy; key data points regarding the orforglipron trial results and the $15 billion share buyback are repeated across three different sections (Analyst Note, Bulls/Bears, and Strategy/Capital Allocation) with no added depth. Finally, the valuation section lacks any scenario or sensitivity analysis, which is a requirement for higher grades given the 'High' uncertainty rating assigned to the stock. These factors combined result in a report that provides a good overview but lacks the analytical depth and comparative rigor required for a higher grade.",
