    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is almost entirely derivative, functioning as a summary of Morningstar\u2019s equity research and recent news headlines from Reuters and AP. Every significant analytical pillar\u2014including the $125 Fair Value Estimate, the 'Wide Moat' rating, the 'Exemplary' capital allocation, and the specific P/E multiples\u2014is explicitly attributed to Morningstar. The discussion of risks (China export bans, TSMC dependency) and the 'Bulls/Bears' section are paraphrased from public news sources without any independent synthesis or unique data points. There is no original thesis or proprietary mechanism presented; the valuation section lacks any novel driver, simply adopting the Morningstar framework. The report fails to provide value-added perspective beyond what is already available in the cited public filings and third-party research. Because there are zero original syntheses or theses, and all insights are either generic or copied from cited sources, the report meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",
