    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to the combination of a material internal contradiction and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. The narrative repeatedly emphasizes 'significant buybacks,' 'large repurchase authorizations,' and the bank's ability to 'increase shareholder returns' following successful stress tests. However, the valuation model explicitly assumes the share count remains 'roughly flat' at 9.5B through 2029. This disconnect between the strategic thesis and the model inputs represents a fundamental failure in internal consistency. Furthermore, while the report identifies critical drivers such as Net Interest Margin (NIM) and credit provisions, it offers no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. The 'Risk & Uncertainty' section remains purely qualitative, failing to provide the valuation impact of potential rate cuts or economic downturns. Per the rubric's hard caps, the presence of one distinct contradiction combined with no quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade. While the report is explicit in stating its inputs (e.g., 9% WACC, 3.3% NIM) and provides specific magnitudes and time horizons, these strengths are undermined by the lack of justification for why NIM would remain 'above historical average' and the failure to reconcile the model with the stated capital allocation strategy.",
