    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for its valuation model, including a 5-year forecast horizon, a 25% tax rate, and a detailed WACC breakdown (8.5% total, comprising a 4% risk-free rate and 5% equity risk premium). These inputs are clearly located in the valuation and appendix sections, satisfying the criteria for explicitness and specificity. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to two primary deficiencies. First, it lacks quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers; while it qualitatively mentions risks and provides a percentage range for trading revenue volatility, it does not provide a sensitivity matrix or quantify the impact of these variables on the $380 Fair Value Estimate. Second, there is a minor internal consistency issue: the text claims the stock trades at 8\u20139x 2026 EPS, but the provided data ($320 price / $42 EPS) calculates to 7.6x. Additionally, the justification for the aggressive operating margin expansion\u2014projected to climb from 22% in 2025 to 30% by 2029\u2014is relatively weak, relying on broad mentions of 'efficiency initiatives' without specific cost-reduction targets or peer benchmarks to support an 800-basis-point improvement in a mature, cyclical industry.",
