    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for its primary valuation drivers, including a five-year revenue CAGR, mid-cycle operating margins, WACC, and terminal growth rates. These inputs are clearly stated in both the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and a dedicated valuation table in the Appendix, ensuring high explicitness and specificity. Justification is solid, as the report links margin expansion to a shift in sales mix toward high-margin segments (AWS and advertising) and cites historical efficiency gains. Internal consistency is high; the 'Financials Snapshot' table perfectly reconciles with the narrative's 2029 targets for revenue ($963B), EPS ($10), and operating margins (15%). However, the report fails to meet the criteria for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade due to a total lack of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While the 'Risk & Uncertainty' section identifies material threats such as regulatory action and AWS competition, it does not quantify how changes in these drivers would impact the fair value estimate. The mention of a '5-star' price threshold is a static valuation metric rather than a dynamic stress test of model inputs. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities on material drivers imposes a hard cap of 'Fair'.",
