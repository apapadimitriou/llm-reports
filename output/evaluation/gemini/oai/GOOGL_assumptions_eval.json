    "summary_reasoning": "Alphabet\u2019s report demonstrates high quality in four of the five pillars of assumptions. The key inputs\u2014including a 10% five-year revenue CAGR, 25% Cloud growth, and a terminal growth rate of 4%\u2014are highly explicit and located proximally to the valuation conclusions. Justification is solid, utilizing multi-year historical data (2022\u20132024) and segment-specific causal drivers, such as AI-driven search monetization and data center capacity expansion. Specificity is a strength, with the report providing precise magnitudes for capital expenditures ($85 billion peak in 2025), share count reductions (2% annually), and margin targets (34\u201335% by 2029). Internal consistency is excellent; the narrative descriptions of margin expansion and EPS growth reconcile perfectly with the provided Financials Snapshot table.\n\nHowever, the report fails the critical requirement for stress-testing. While it qualitatively discusses risks\u2014such as regulatory pressure and AI competition\u2014it provides no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. There are no bull/bear cases or tables showing how the $237 fair value estimate would fluctuate based on changes to material drivers like WACC, terminal growth, or advertising growth rates. Per the rubric\u2019s hard caps, the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers mandates a maximum grade of 'Fair,' despite the otherwise high level of detail and justification provided in the core model assumptions.",
