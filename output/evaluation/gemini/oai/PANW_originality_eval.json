    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, functioning instead as a summary of public news and regulatory filings. Every core insight is either a generic restatement of industry norms or a direct paraphrase of cited sources. For instance, the critique of the CyberArk acquisition (including the 1% ROI figure and the $16B market cap loss) is taken directly from Reuters Breakingviews. The 'platformization' thesis is the company's own stated strategy and is widely reported in the financial press. The valuation section is entirely boilerplate, utilizing standard DCF mechanics (WACC, terminal growth, and margin expansion through 'scale') without introducing any novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. There is no evidence of the author linking disparate data points to form a new conclusion; rather, the report compiles existing headlines. Per the decision rules, the absence of any synthesis or original thesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
