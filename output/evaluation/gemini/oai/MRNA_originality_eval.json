    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is almost entirely a compilation of publicly available information, press releases, and third-party ratings (Alpha Spread, Sustainalytics, Reuters). It fails to provide any original synthesis or a unique investment thesis. Every 'insight' provided is a restatement of management guidance (revenue/opex targets), recent news (UK patent win), or external analysis (moat rating). The valuation section uses a standard DCF framework with a generic 'hockey stick' revenue recovery (50% CAGR) that lacks a specific, quantified mechanism or competitive angle beyond 'product approvals.' There is no attempt to link the patent victory to specific financial outcomes or to analyze the efficiency of R&D spend beyond quoting management's cost-cutting targets. Consequently, the report offers zero value-add over a basic news aggregator or a company press release. Because there are zero original syntheses or theses, and nearly all insights are restatements of public headlines, the report meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",
