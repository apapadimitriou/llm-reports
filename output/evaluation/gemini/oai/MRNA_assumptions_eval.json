    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report receives a 'Poor' grade due to multiple unresolved numeric contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, combined with a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. Specifically, the text forecasts 2029 revenue of approximately $12 billion, while the Financials Snapshot table lists it as $10 billion. Similarly, the narrative projects 2029 operating margins of 15\u201320%, yet the table displays 25%. A third discrepancy exists for 2027 EPS, cited as $3 in the text but $5 in the table. These internal inconsistencies undermine the report's credibility and auditability.\n\nFurthermore, while the report identifies material risks such as vaccine uptake and regulatory setbacks, it fails to provide any quantified scenarios or sensitivity tables (e.g., varying WACC or revenue growth rates) to show the impact on the $50 fair-value estimate. This lack of stress-testing makes the valuation feel like a 'black box.' Justification for the aggressive ~50% revenue CAGR is also weak, relying on broad 'product approvals' without detailed market-sizing or pricing assumptions for the RSV and flu pipelines. While some parameters like WACC (10%) and terminal growth (3%) are explicit, they are not tied to specific benchmarks or peer data, leaving them poorly justified. The cumulative effect of these contradictions and the lack of sensitivity analysis triggers the hard cap for a 'Poor' rating.",
