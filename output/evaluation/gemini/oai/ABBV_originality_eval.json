    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original analysis, relying entirely on paraphrasing news headlines and public filings. Every major point\u2014from the $30B immunology sales target to the 15% tariff impact on Botox\u2014is explicitly cited from Reuters or AbbVie press releases without additional interpretive value. There is no evidence of synthesis where multiple data points are linked to form a new conclusion; instead, the report presents a collection of facts. The valuation section is a standard DCF with boilerplate assumptions (mid-single-digit growth, 25% margin) that lacks any company-specific novel drivers or mechanisms. Because the report lacks even a single weak synthesis and relies on more than three paraphrased insights, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the decision rules.",
