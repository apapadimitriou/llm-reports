    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report earns a 'Poor' grade due to two major internal contradictions and insufficient sensitivity analysis. First, there is a fundamental mathematical error in the WACC calculation: the report assumes a 30% Cost of Equity and 0% Debt Cost but arrives at a 10% WACC. This would require a 66% debt weighting, yet the report describes the firm as 'Net Cash positive' with a $99B implied equity value against only $2B in debt. Second, a significant discrepancy exists between the narrative's $10B revenue target for FY2029 and the financial snapshot table, which forecasts only $7.378B for the same period. While assumptions for revenue growth (22% CAGR) and margin expansion (to 20%) are explicitly stated and specific, they lack robust justification against historical GAAP losses ($-830M in FY24). Finally, sensitivity analysis is inadequate, providing only a single-point impact for WACC while ignoring material operational drivers like revenue growth or efficiency ratios. These logical and numeric failures render the model's outputs 'black-box' and internally incoherent.",
