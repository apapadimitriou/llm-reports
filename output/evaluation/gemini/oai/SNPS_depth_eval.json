    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits a high level of analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive summaries to provide clear causal reasoning. It explicitly links the \"rising AI-driven chip complexity\" to sustained demand for EDA tools and explains that \"operating margins ~50\u201355%... due to scale\" will drive profitability. The inference quality is high, with forecasts tied to specific drivers like the \"high switching costs\" inherent in the EDA market. Data usage is robust; the analyst provides a detailed DCF framework with explicit assumptions, including a \"WACC of ~9% and terminal FCF growth 3%,\" and benchmarks the valuation using a \"2026E P/E of ~22x vs. peers around ~25x.\" Regarding uncertainty, the report identifies significant geopolitical headwinds, specifically quantifying that \"trade frictions could impair revenue growth by 5\u201310%\" annually. While this provides a helpful sensitivity point, the report lacks a comprehensive sensitivity analysis or multiple valuation scenarios (e.g., Bull/Bear cases), which prevents it from reaching the \"Excellent\" grade. The implications are actionable, providing a clear Fair-Value Estimate of $520.00 against a current price of $450.00, suggesting a specific margin of safety. Overall, the reasoning is mechanism-rich and well-supported by industry context and peer comparisons.",
