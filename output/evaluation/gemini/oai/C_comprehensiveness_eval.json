    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a complete structural framework, including all required sections from the Analyst Note to ESG and Capital Allocation. Sourcing is a notable strength; the analyst utilizes high-quality sources (Reuters, FT, SEC filings) with consistent in-text citations. However, the report fails to achieve a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to significant deficiencies in sector-specific depth and structural efficiency. The most critical gap is in the Financials Snapshot, which provides only generic metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF) and entirely omits core banking KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Net Interest Income (NII), and Provisions for Credit Losses. While some metrics like CET1 and ROTCE are mentioned in the text, their absence from the primary data table triggers a hard cap of 'Fair.' Furthermore, the report exhibits pervasive redundancy. Key data points\u2014specifically the Q1 2025 equity trading surge, the 11\u201312% ROTCE target, and the $20 billion buyback\u2014are repeated across the Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and Bulls/Bears sections with no additional depth or analytical layering. This repetition, combined with the lack of a dedicated peer benchmarking table or scenario-based sensitivity analysis, results in a report that feels more like a compilation of news snippets than a synthesized investment thesis. Consequently, the report meets the criteria for 'Fair' but lacks the specialized rigor required for a higher grade.",
