    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates exceptional structural and narrative coherence, reading as a single, unified argument. It successfully integrates historical data (2022\u20132024) with forward-looking estimates (2025\u20132029) across all sections. The Analyst Note sets a clear stage by discussing Q1 2025 results, which are then consistently supported by the Financials Snapshot and the Fair Value section. Specifically, the narrative regarding retail margin expansion and AWS growth is threaded through the Strategy, Bulls/Bears, and Valuation sections without contradiction. The report proactively reconciles Bear concerns\u2014such as slowing AWS growth and high capex\u2014by explaining the transition to AI-driven growth and the moderation of fulfillment spending in the Capital Allocation and Analyst Note sections. Temporal accuracy is precise; the report is dated June 2025 and correctly identifies Q1 2025 as the most recent earnings period. Terminology like 'operating margin,' 'ROIC,' and 'CAGR' is used accurately and consistently between the text and the Financials table. The use of citations is robust, providing a clear trail for the data points used to build the argument. There are no internal tensions between the narrative claims of efficiency and the projected margin improvements in the appendix.",
    "evidence": [
        "The forecast of margins rising to the 'mid-teens within five years' in the Fair Value section aligns perfectly with the 15.0% target for 2029 in the Financials Snapshot.",
        "The Analyst Note's mention of AWS revenue increasing 17% in Q1 2025 is reconciled with the Bear case's concern over 'sub-20% growth' by highlighting AI-driven long-term prospects.",
        "Explicit cross-referencing: 'Morningstar similarly noted... they raised their operating margin forecast by 160 basis points for 2024' (Fair Value section) links back to the profitability discussion in the Analyst Note."
