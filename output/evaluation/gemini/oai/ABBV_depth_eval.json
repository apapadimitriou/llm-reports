    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a clear causal narrative regarding AbbVie\u2019s transition from its legacy Humira franchise to newer immunology platforms, noting that \"Humira revenue fell... confirming patent-cliff pressures\" while \"Skyrizi and Rinvoq... on track for ~$30 B by 2027.\" It offers explicit valuation assumptions, stating a \"WACC of 8.0% and terminal growth of 2.0%,\" and provides a multi-year forecast for revenue and margins. However, the analytical depth is limited by a lack of rigorous benchmarking or stress-testing. While it identifies significant risks, such as how a \"15% tariff on EU imports... add unpredictability,\" it fails to quantify the impact of these variables on the fair value estimate or earnings. There are no sensitivity tables or bull/bear case valuations to help investors understand the range of potential outcomes. The conclusion that \"valuation unexciting... share price trades near fair value\" is actionable but lacks the supporting scenario analysis required for a higher grade. The report effectively describes the 'what' and 'why' of current performance but stops short of modeling the 'what if,' leaving the valuation sensitive to unexamined changes in its core assumptions.",
