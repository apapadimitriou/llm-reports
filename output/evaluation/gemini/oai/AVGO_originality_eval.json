    "summary_reasoning": "The report is almost entirely derivative, functioning as a compilation of existing Morningstar research and public news headlines rather than an independent analysis. Every core component of the investment thesis\u2014including the $190 Fair Value Estimate, the 'Wide' moat rating, the 12% revenue CAGR, and the 'Exemplary' capital allocation rating\u2014is explicitly attributed to or copied from Morningstar. There is no evidence of original synthesis; the report merely restates data points from sources like KGI Securities (the 1 million XPU cluster target) and Reuters (Apple's in-house chip risk) without adding interpretive commentary or new conclusions. The valuation section is a boilerplate restatement of a standard DCF model using third-party assumptions, lacking any novel drivers or proprietary mechanisms. Because the report contains zero original theses or syntheses and relies on \u22653 paraphrased/generic insights, it fails to meet the criteria for a higher grade and is capped at 'Poor' per the decision rules.",
