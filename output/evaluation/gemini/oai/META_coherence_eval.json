    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong structural coherence and internal consistency between the narrative and the financial tables. The transition from the 'year of efficiency' (2023) to the heavy AI investment phase (2025) is clearly explained, justifying the projected dip in operating margins from 45% in 2024 to 40% in 2025. The valuation model's assumptions regarding revenue growth (12% CAGR) and terminal margins (45%) are explicitly linked to the 'Family of Apps' dominance and the eventual normalization of CapEx. However, the report suffers from a significant temporal flaw: it is dated June 16, 2025, yet it cites a Financial Times article (Source 12) dated June 30, 2025, to support claims about debt financing. This use of a 'future' source relative to the report's publication date violates the requirement for temporal accuracy. Additionally, the Bulls/Bears are effectively reconciled with the base case; for instance, the Bear concern regarding Reality Labs' losses is addressed in the valuation narrative by accounting for heavy near-term investment before margin stabilization. Because of the temporal inaccuracy regarding the citation date, the grade is capped at fair despite the otherwise high quality of the narrative flow and data alignment.",
