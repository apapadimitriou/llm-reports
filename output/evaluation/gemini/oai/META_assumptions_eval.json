    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high levels of explicitness, specificity, and internal consistency, but it is strictly limited to a 'Fair' grade due to the total absence of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. On the positive side, assumptions are clearly stated and proximal to the forecasts they inform. The report provides a detailed valuation appendix covering WACC components (Risk-Free Rate, ERP, Beta), tax rates, and share counts, all of which reconcile perfectly with the narrative and the 'Financials Snapshot' table. Justification is solid, linking the 12% revenue CAGR to specific drivers like Reels monetization and AI-driven personalization, while the margin assumptions account for the tension between efficiency gains and increased AI CapEx. However, the report fails the 'Stress-tested' pillar entirely. Despite assigning a 'High' uncertainty rating and identifying material risks such as regulatory fines and cyclical ad spending, the analyst provides no quantified impact of these variables on the $400 fair value estimate. There are no bull/bear cases or sensitivity tables for the 8.5% WACC or 4% terminal growth rate (the latter being notably high without specific justification). Per the grading rubric's hard caps, the lack of quantified sensitivities on material drivers mandates a maximum grade of 'Fair'.",
