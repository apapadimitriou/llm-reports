    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits high analytical depth through robust causal explanations and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. The analyst effectively links the strategic shift toward Apache Iceberg and Snowflake Cortex to specific financial outcomes, such as the trade-off between lower-margin storage revenue and higher-margin compute revenue. Verbatim evidence includes: \u201cRPO growth... is a leading indicator of future revenue acceleration\u201d and \u201cheadwinds from storage optimization... being successfully offset by tailwinds.\u201d The valuation section provides explicit parameters, such as \u201cWACC: 9.5%... Terminal Growth Rate: 4.0%,\u201d and benchmarks these against the 10Y Treasury and global GDP. The report also identifies causal mechanisms for margin pressure, noting \u201cGenAI workloads are compute-intensive... Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) naturally rises.\u201d While the report identifies significant risks and counterpoints\u2014such as the \u201cIceberg deflationary risk\u201d and competition from Databricks\u2014it stops short of providing quantified sensitivity analysis or multi-scenario modeling. For instance, while it acknowledges that \u201csome sources suggest a higher WACC (up to 15%),\u201d it does not calculate the resulting impact on the price target. Consequently, while the reasoning is mechanism-rich and the implications are actionable, the lack of quantified ranges or stress-tested scenarios limits the grade to \u201cGood\u201d under the defined criteria.",
