    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s quality of assumptions is graded as Poor due to the presence of internal numeric contradictions and the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is commendable for its explicitness\u2014clearly tabulating revenue, margin, EPS, and AUM forecasts through 2029\u2014it fails to reconcile these figures with its narrative claims. Specifically, the text asserts a 10.5% EPS CAGR and 9.5% average revenue growth, yet the data provided in the 'Financial Projections Summary' table results in a 9.85% EPS CAGR and a 9.88% revenue average. These discrepancies undermine the auditability of the model.\n\nFurthermore, the report violates a critical hard cap by providing no quantified stress-testing or scenario analysis for material drivers such as WACC, terminal growth, or operating margins. While it identifies qualitative risks like integration and market volatility, it fails to provide the valuation impact of these variables (e.g., a sensitivity matrix). Justification for key valuation inputs is also thin; the 8.5% WACC and 3.5% terminal growth rate are stated as point estimates without showing the underlying calculation or peer benchmarking. Although the report is specific regarding units and time horizons, the lack of internal coherence and the 'black-box' nature of the valuation outputs\u2014given the lack of sensitivities\u2014result in a Poor rating per the instruction's hard caps.",
