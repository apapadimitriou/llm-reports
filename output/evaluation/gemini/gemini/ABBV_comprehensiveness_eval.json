    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report on AbbVie Inc. demonstrates a high level of structural completeness, including all mandatory sections from the Analyst Note to a detailed ESG analysis and source list. The qualitative discussion is robust, particularly regarding the strategic transition from Humira to the Skyrizi and Rinvoq growth platform. The valuation section is technically sound, providing an explicit link between operating drivers (7.5% revenue CAGR, margin expansion) and the $195 fair value estimate via a DCF model. However, the report is held back by significant omissions in the quantitative presentation and a lack of advanced analytical depth. The Financials Snapshot table is generic and fails to include at least two core biopharma sector KPIs: R&D expenditure and specific pipeline progression metrics (e.g., Phase III asset counts). While these are mentioned in the text, their absence from the primary financial summary triggers a hard cap of 'Fair.' Additionally, the report lacks any scenario or sensitivity analysis, such as a bull/bear case valuation or a WACC sensitivity matrix, which is expected for higher grades. Peer benchmarking is limited to the ESG section, with no comparative valuation multiples provided for industry peers like Johnson & Johnson or Eli Lilly. Finally, the report exhibits high redundancy, repeating the same data points regarding immunology sales and the Humira patent cliff across five different sections without providing incremental depth, necessitating a downgrade.",
