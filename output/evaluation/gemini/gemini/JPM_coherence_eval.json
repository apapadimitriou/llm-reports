    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a poor grade due to severe, fundamental contradictions regarding its timeline and internal logic that compromise its credibility as a connected argument. The most glaring issue is a temporal impossibility: the report is dated July 8, 2025, yet the Analyst Note and Capital Allocation sections cite specific financial results and share repurchases from July 15, 2025. This discrepancy extends to the Sources section, which lists multiple entries dated in late July and August 2025 (e.g., Sources 5, 8, and 14), making the document's stated publication date factually impossible relative to its content. Furthermore, the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section contains a significant internal contradiction regarding its forecast horizon. It claims to project a diluted EPS CAGR of 8.3% over the next decade, but then defines the end of this period as 2029\u2014a span of only four years from the 2025 starting point. While the narrative style is professional and the sections are organized logically, these structural failures mean the reader cannot rely on the report's internal consistency. The Bulls Say / Bears Say section is adequately reconciled within the valuation narrative through the discussion of normalization, but this strength is overshadowed by the failure to align dates, data, and cited sources. These are not minor rough edges but systemic errors that require the reader to reconstruct the basic facts of the analysis.",

        "Sources 8 and 14 are dated 2025-08-04 and 2025-08-08, respectively, both occurring weeks after the report's stated date (Sources)."
