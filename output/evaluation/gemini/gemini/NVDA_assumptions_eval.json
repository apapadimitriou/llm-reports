    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high quality in four of the five pillars but fails significantly on the fifth. Regarding explicitness, the key inputs for the DCF model\u2014including WACC, terminal growth, and multi-year revenue targets\u2014are clearly presented in both the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and a dedicated Appendix. Justification is solid; the analyst provides specific causal drivers for the 54% revenue growth in FY2026, citing the Blackwell architecture ramp and the $30 billion cumulative impact of the China export ban reversal. Specificity is excellent, with clearly defined units, a five-year explicit forecast horizon, and granular WACC components (beta, risk-free rate, and equity risk premium). Internal consistency is a strength, as there are zero contradictions between the narrative's margin peaks and the 'Financials Snapshot' table. However, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While it acknowledges 'Very High Uncertainty' and lists qualitative risks like geopolitical friction and customer concentration, it does not provide a range of outcomes or quantify how changes in material drivers (e.g., a 1% change in WACC or a slowdown in AI capital expenditures) would impact the $195 fair value estimate. According to the mandatory grading instructions, the absence of quantified stress-testing on material drivers caps the final grade at 'Fair,' regardless of the strength of the other evaluative categories.",
