    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a competent overview of Meta's current strategic pivot but relies heavily on restating public information. It contains two notable syntheses: first, the 'depreciation bomb' thesis, which links the $66B-$72B CapEx guidance to a specific GAAP operating margin contraction (42% to 38%) via accelerated depreciation; second, the interpretation of Reality Labs' rebranding toward 'wearables' as a tactical move to align with the AI narrative. However, the report is heavily weighed down by restated content, including a summary of management's 'Five Pillars of AI,' third-party estimates for WhatsApp monetization, and boilerplate regulatory and ESG risk assessments. Because more than three insights are essentially restatements of management guidance or external data (Q2 guidance, AI pillars, WhatsApp revenue potential, and Sustainalytics scores), the report is capped at 'Fair' per the instruction's hard caps. The valuation section uses a standard DCF and SOTP approach without introducing a novel driver or mechanism beyond a risk-adjusted WACC.",
