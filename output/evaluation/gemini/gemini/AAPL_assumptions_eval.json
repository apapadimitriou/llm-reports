    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high explicitness and specificity, providing a dedicated 'Key Valuation Assumptions' table in the Appendix and clearly stating drivers within the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section. Assumptions for WACC (8.23%), revenue CAGR (6.5%), and terminal growth (3.0%) are precisely defined with specific time horizons (FY25\u201329). Justification is solid, linking margin expansion to the structural shift toward the high-margin Services segment and justifying revenue growth through the 'Pro' model mix and installed base monetization. Internal consistency is clean; the narrative's 34% exit operating margin and 6.5% CAGR reconcile perfectly with the Financials Snapshot and Appendix. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to the lack of robust, quantified sensitivity analysis for core model drivers. While it provides a specific downside scenario for tariffs (15% net valuation impact), it fails to provide quantified ranges or sensitivity tables for primary levers such as WACC, terminal growth, or Services growth rates. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities for multiple material drivers prevents a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating.",
