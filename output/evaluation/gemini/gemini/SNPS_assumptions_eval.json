    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for its valuation model, including a clearly stated WACC (8.5%), terminal growth rate (3.5%), and multi-year margin expansion targets. These inputs are proximal to the forecasts and generally justified by the strategic rationale of the Ansys acquisition and historical segment performance (e.g., Design IP growth). The internal consistency between the narrative and the financial snapshot in Table 1 is high, with revenue jumps and margin improvements reconciling across the text. However, the report fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. While it qualitatively discusses 'Bull vs. Bear' cases and geopolitical risks, it does not provide quantified ranges for material drivers (such as the impact of a China revenue loss or variations in synergy realization) on the price target. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers mandates a maximum grade of 'Fair'.",
