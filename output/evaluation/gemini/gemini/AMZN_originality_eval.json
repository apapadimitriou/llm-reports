    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a summary of Amazon's Q2 2025 earnings results and management's stated strategy rather than providing original analysis. It fails to present any unique synthesis or original thesis. Every identified insight is either a direct restatement of financial data (e.g., the 190 bps margin expansion), a paraphrase of management's own explanations from the earnings call (e.g., AWS capacity constraints due to power availability), or a generic industry observation (e.g., AI investments pressuring margins). The valuation section is entirely boilerplate, utilizing standard DCF assumptions and consensus growth rates without introducing any novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' and 'Economic Moat' sections rely on well-worn narratives like the 'Amazon Flywheel' and 'Network Effects' that have been public knowledge for over a decade. There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points to form a new, testable conclusion. Consequently, the report offers zero decision-relevant originality beyond what is already available in public filings and news headlines.",
