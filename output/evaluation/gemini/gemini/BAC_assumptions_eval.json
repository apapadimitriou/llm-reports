    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to significant internal numeric contradictions and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers. A major contradiction exists between the stated 2024 annual revenue of $192.4 billion (averaging ~$48 billion per quarter) and the Q1 2025 revenue of $27.4 billion. The narrative characterizes this 43% sequential decline as a 'strong' performance that 'surpassed analyst expectations,' which is logically irreconcilable. Furthermore, the report assumes a 7.0% long-term earnings growth rate for a mature, systemically important financial institution; this is highly aggressive and lacks justification beyond a vague reference to consensus. While the report includes a 'football field' chart, this merely displays the outputs of different valuation methodologies rather than stress-testing material drivers like Net Interest Income (NII) or credit provisions. Per the grading instructions, the combination of unresolved numeric contradictions and the lack of quantified sensitivities on material levers necessitates a 'Poor' grade. Although some inputs like the cost of equity (7.05%) are specific, they are undermined by the structural incoherence between the report's tables and its narrative conclusions.",
