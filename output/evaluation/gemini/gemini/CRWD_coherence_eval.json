    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of structural coherence and detailed financial analysis, but it is fundamentally undermined by a significant temporal contradiction. The 'Executive Summary' and 'Key Stock Data' table establish a 'Current Price' as of June 3, 2025. However, the 'Earnings Analysis' section provides a detailed review of Q2 FY26 results for the 'Quarter ending July 31, 2025,' and the 'Works Cited' section lists access dates in September 2025. This creates a logical impossibility where the 'current' market price predates the 'recent' financial results and the report's own composition date. This mismatch invalidates the 'current' valuation multiples (e.g., 21.5x EV/Sales), as they are calculated using a price that is three months stale relative to the earnings data. \n\nBeyond this temporal flaw, the report is well-integrated. The 'Thesis Conclusion' effectively reconciles the 'Bull Case' (market leadership and AI tailwinds) with the 'Bear Case' (outage fallout and valuation) to justify the HOLD rating. Transitions between sections are smooth, and the DCF assumptions (19.5% CAGR, 8.9% WACC) are explicitly cross-referenced with management's $10 billion ARR target and Morningstar\u2019s uncertainty ratings. The narrative and tables are internally consistent regarding financial figures, such as the $4.78 billion revenue midpoint for FY26. However, the temporal inaccuracy triggers a mandatory hard cap under the grading guidelines.",

        "Current Price (as of June 3, 2025): $417.63 (Executive Summary) vs. Review of Q2 FY26 Results (Quarter ending July 31, 2025) (Earnings Analysis)",
        "Works cited... accessed September 10, 2025 (Appendix) contradicts the June 2025 'current' date used for the investment recommendation.",
        "The Thesis Conclusion successfully reconciles the 'fundamental tension' between premier market position and 'post-outage headwinds' to support the HOLD rating."
