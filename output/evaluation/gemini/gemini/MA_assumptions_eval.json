    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s assumptions are clearly explicit and proximal to the forecasts, appearing in both the valuation narrative and a dedicated appendix. Justification is solid, leveraging multi-year historical data (e.g., 2024 ROIC and margins) and cited external benchmarks like Kroll\u2019s equity risk premium and the 10-year Treasury yield. Specificity is also high, with clear units, time horizons (5-year DCF), and causal drivers (secular shift to digital, value-added services growth). However, the report fails on two critical 'Hard Cap' criteria. First, there is a total absence of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis; while risks like regulatory pressure and macro cyclicality are identified, their impact on the $615 fair value estimate is never modeled. Second, the report contains multiple internal numeric contradictions. The narrative specifies a 11.5% revenue CAGR, but the year-over-year growth rates in the Financials Snapshot (12.5% down to 10.0%) result in a geometric average of 11.1%. Additionally, the text forecasts a terminal operating margin of 59.5%, which conflicts with the 59.8% figure presented in the 2029 forecast table. Per the instruction that one contradiction plus no sensitivities (or two distinct contradictions) triggers a 'Poor' grade, this report cannot be rated higher despite its strong justifications.",
