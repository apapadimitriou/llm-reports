    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, functioning instead as a comprehensive recap of public regulatory filings, press releases, and consensus narratives. Every 'insight' identified is a restatement of existing information: the reduction in the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) is a mechanical regulatory update, the 'trapped capital' argument is management's own multi-year narrative, and the description of the Services segment as the 'crown jewel' is a direct paraphrase of cited Morningstar and company materials. The report relies heavily on boilerplate industry tropes such as the 'Show Me story' and 'Value Trap' without adding interpretive depth. The valuation section is particularly generic, applying a textbook 1.0x P/TBV multiple based on the standard theory that banks earning their cost of capital should trade at book value, offering no novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. Because the report lacks any clear synthesis of data into new conclusions and relies entirely on paraphrasing cited sources, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade in originality.",
