    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit, specific, and internally consistent assumptions for its core forecasts. Key drivers, such as the 28% product revenue growth and 9% non-GAAP operating margin for FY26, are clearly stated and justified using a combination of management guidance and recent Q4 FY25 performance metrics (e.g., 126% NRR and 33% RPO growth). Valuation parameters, including a 9.5% WACC and 4.0% terminal growth rate, are explicitly derived from cited market data like the 10Y Treasury and specific Beta estimates. The report maintains high internal consistency; for instance, the FY27 revenue estimate of $5.7 billion correctly applies the assumed 28% growth rate to the FY26 guidance. However, the report fails the 'stress-tested' requirement entirely. While Section 8 identifies material risks\u2014such as consumption volatility, AI-driven margin compression, and competitive pressure from Databricks\u2014these are discussed only qualitatively. There is no quantified sensitivity analysis, such as a table showing the impact of varying WACC or revenue growth rates on the $235.00 price target. Per the mandatory hard caps in the instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers limits the maximum possible grade to 'Fair.'",
