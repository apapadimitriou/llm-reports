    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to the presence of internal numeric contradictions combined with a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis, triggering a mandatory hard cap in the evaluation criteria. While the report explicitly lists key DCF inputs\u2014such as a 10.3% WACC, 3.0% terminal growth, and a 15.0% terminal operating margin\u2014these figures lack robust justification. The WACC is vaguely attributed to 'industry benchmarks' without disclosing the cost of equity, beta, or risk-free rate components, and the 5-year revenue CAGR is simply aligned with 'consensus' rather than an independent build. \n\nA significant internal contradiction exists regarding the company's operating margin: the valuation section (Section 8) cites a 'current level of approximately 11.4%,' yet the financial snapshot table (Section 11) records the FY2024 margin at 10.8% and the FY2025 estimate at 11.9%, leaving the 11.4% figure as an unreconciled outlier. Furthermore, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers like AWS growth rates or the massive $100 billion capex cycle. Despite identifying these as primary risks, the analyst offers no quantified impact on the $245 price target under varying conditions. This 'black-box' approach to valuation, where material inputs are stated but not stress-tested or consistently reconciled with the provided financial tables, fundamentally undermines the audibility and reliability of the report\u2019s conclusions.",
