    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a foundational level of analytical depth by identifying key causal drivers and providing explicit, benchmarked assumptions. It successfully links results to mechanisms, such as noting that \"operating leverage and a favorable revenue mix shift\" will drive margin expansion. The inclusion of a quantified EPS bridge\u2014attributing growth to \"Revenue Growth Contribution: ~$1.80\" and \"Share Repurchase Contribution: ~$0.55\"\u2014demonstrates an attempt to tie forecasts to specific drivers. Furthermore, the valuation is transparent, utilizing a \"WACC of 9.8%... terminal growth rate of 4.0%\" with components benchmarked against the 10-year Treasury and Kroll ERP. However, the report is capped at \"Fair\" because it lacks any form of stress-testing or quantified sensitivity analysis. While it identifies significant risks, such as a \"complex and increasingly scrutinized regulatory landscape\" and \"technological disruption\" from A2A systems, these counterpoints are merely mentioned rather than explored through financial modeling. There are no \"if-then\" scenarios (e.g., the impact of a 50bps interchange fee cap) or valuation ranges. The analysis is entirely deterministic, providing a single fair value estimate without acknowledging how sensitive that value is to its underlying assumptions. Consequently, while the report is data-rich, it fails to provide the conditional, decision-relevant implications necessary for a higher grade. Verbatim excerpts: 1. \"operating leverage and a favorable revenue mix shift\"; 2. \"WACC of 9.8%... terminal growth rate of 4.0%\"; 3. \"Revenue Growth Contribution: ~$1.80 per share\"; 4. \"Share repurchase... ~$0.55 per share\"; 5. \"regulatory landscape... persistent threat\"; 6. \"revenue grew 14%... resilient consumer spending\".",
