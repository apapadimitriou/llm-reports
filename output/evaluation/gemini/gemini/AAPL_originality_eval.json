    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a comprehensive overview of Apple's strategic position but lacks truly original insights. Most of the analysis consists of restating consensus views or specific points already published by Morningstar and other cited analysts. For example, the skepticism regarding 'Apple Intelligence' as a super-cycle catalyst and the quantification of tariff risk (15% net) are directly attributed to existing research rather than being the result of original synthesis. While the report correctly identifies the shift from hardware units to ecosystem cash flow, this has been a standard market thesis for several years. The valuation section uses standard drivers\u2014specifically the Services-led margin expansion\u2014without introducing any novel mechanisms or company-specific angles not already available in public filings. Because more than three insights are classified as generic restatements or paraphrased from sources, and the valuation lacks a novel driver, the report is capped at the 'Fair' grade according to the instruction's hard caps.",
