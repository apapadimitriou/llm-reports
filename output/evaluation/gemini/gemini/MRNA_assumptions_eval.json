    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions assessment due to multiple internal contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis, triggering the 'Poor' hard cap. Most critically, there is a massive unresolved numeric discrepancy regarding share count: Table 1 reports 388 million shares outstanding, yet the SOTP valuation in Table 4 utilizes 890 million diluted shares without providing a bridge or justification for this 129% increase. Furthermore, Table 1 cites a FY2026 consensus revenue of $9.75B, while the report's own financial forecast in Table 5 projects only $5.5B for the same period, a nearly 50% variance that is never reconciled in the narrative. \n\nWhile the report is explicit in listing its SOTP inputs (WACC, PoS, Peak Sales), the justification for these drivers is weak, relying on 'internal analyst estimates' and 'industry averages' rather than specific peer benchmarking or historical context. Finally, despite the 'Very High' uncertainty rating and the text mentioning that sensitivity analysis was 'considered,' the report provides no quantified ranges, scenarios, or sensitivity tables for material levers like the 8.85% WACC or the Probability of Success (PoS) for the oncology pipeline. Per the instructions, the presence of two distinct contradictions combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
