    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is professionally written with a clear narrative arc, transitioning smoothly from the Q2 earnings beat to the strategic 'Great Pivot' into private markets. It successfully reconciles the company's strategic strengths with a valuation-based 'Underperform' rating, satisfying the requirement to address bull/bear tensions. However, the report fails significantly on temporal consistency and internal quantitative alignment. Most glaringly, the report is dated July 7, 2025, but the 'Works Cited' section lists dozens of sources accessed on September 10, 2025. This chronological impossibility violates the requirement for precise temporal claims. Furthermore, there is an unresolved tension in the valuation section: the analyst emphasizes a P/FCF multiple of 246x as evidence of an 'Ultra Expensive' and 'stretched' valuation, yet the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis produces a fair value of $980. This price target represents only an 11.4% downside from the current price of $1,106, which is inconsistent with the 'Ultra Expensive' rhetoric and the 'Priced for Perfection' thesis. Additionally, while the report claims to use 'conservative' margin assumptions to justify an EPS forecast below consensus, the 2025 revenue growth in the summary table (13.9%) actually exceeds the 13% YoY growth reported in the 'strong' Q2 results, creating a slight narrative-to-table friction regarding the pace of the slowdown. Due to the temporal inaccuracies and these quantitative tensions, the report is capped at a 'fair' grade.",
