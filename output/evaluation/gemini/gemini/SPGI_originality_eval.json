    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report primarily relies on a single public event\u2014the April 2025 announcement of the Mobility division spin-off\u2014as its central thesis. While the report correctly identifies the strategic rationale for this move (portfolio simplification and margin expansion), these points largely paraphrase the company's own investor communications rather than providing original analysis. The report contains one clear synthesis: linking the 2026\u20132028 'maturity wall' to a floor in Ratings revenue despite high interest rates. However, the remaining insights regarding the shift to passive investing, AI integration via Kensho, and the 'Big Three' oligopoly are generic sector-wide narratives applicable to any major credit rating agency or index provider. The valuation section lacks a truly novel driver, as the projected margin expansion is a mathematical byproduct of removing the lower-margin Mobility segment rather than an analyst-derived operational insight. Because more than three insights are restatements of public news or generic sector trends, the grade is capped at Fair.",
