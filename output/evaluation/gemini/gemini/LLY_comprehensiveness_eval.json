    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded as 'Good' because it provides a comprehensive analysis of Eli Lilly, covering all essential sections including a detailed investment thesis, valuation, and risk assessment. The analyst successfully integrates sector-specific KPIs such as net realized pricing (projected decline from $7,000 to $3,000), market share (60% for Zepbound), and manufacturing scale-up ($50B investment). The valuation section is a highlight, featuring a 10-year DCF with explicit operating drivers (revenue growth and margin expansion) and a transparent WACC calculation. Peer benchmarking is effectively utilized in both the valuation multiples and the ESG risk rating comparison. However, the report falls short of an 'Excellent' grade for two primary reasons. First, the 'Financials Snapshot' lacks a structured multi-year historical and forecast table; while data for 2024 and 2025 are provided, the long-term projections are relegated to narrative text rather than a clear data grid. Second, there is notable redundancy across sections. The core arguments regarding 'stratospheric valuation' compared to tech firms and 'pricing pressure from payers' are repeated in the Executive Summary, the Investment Thesis, and the Risk Assessment without significant additional depth in subsequent mentions. Per the instruction's hard caps regarding repetition across two or more sections, this necessitates a one-level downgrade from Excellent to Good.",
