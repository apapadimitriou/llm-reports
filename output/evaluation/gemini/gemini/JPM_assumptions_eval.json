    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to the combination of material internal contradictions and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst provides explicit inputs for the DCF model\u2014including a 10.5% cost of equity, 3.0% terminal growth, and an 18.5% mid-cycle ROTCE\u2014these are undermined by numeric discrepancies. Specifically, the narrative claims a 4.0% five-year revenue CAGR, yet the financial snapshot table shows revenue growing from $177.6B in 2024 to $208.4B in 2029, which calculates to a significantly lower 3.25% CAGR. Additionally, the report forecasts an 8.3% EPS CAGR 'over the next decade,' but the provided data only spans four years (2025\u20132029), creating a temporal contradiction. Crucially, the report fails the hard cap for sensitivity analysis; despite identifying a 40% probability of a U.S. recession and highlighting risks like tariffs and interest rate volatility, it provides no quantified scenarios or stress tests showing the impact of these variables on the $235 fair-value estimate. Without these ranges, the valuation remains a 'black box,' and the lack of reconciliation between the text and the financial tables suggests a lack of internal coherence across the five pillars of assumption quality.",
