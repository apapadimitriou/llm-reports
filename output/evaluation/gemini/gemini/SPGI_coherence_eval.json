    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong structural coherence, effectively linking the strategic divestiture of the Mobility segment to the broader valuation thesis and margin expansion projections. The narrative transitions smoothly between the Analyst Note and the detailed segment descriptions, maintaining a consistent focus on the 'Essential Intelligence' mission. However, the report fails the temporal accuracy check, which necessitates a hard cap of 'fair' under the provided rubric. Specifically, the report is dated July 2, 2025, but the bibliography includes sources dated September 2025 and December 2025. This internal chronological contradiction undermines the document's credibility as a point-in-time analysis. Furthermore, there is a mathematical inconsistency between the narrative and the data tables: the Fair Value section explicitly forecasts a 7.8% revenue CAGR for the 2025-2029 period, yet the data provided in the Financials Snapshot table calculates to an 8.0% CAGR. While the Bulls/Bears arguments are well-reconciled within the valuation and risk sections, these technical and temporal errors prevent a higher grade. The use of terminology like 'maturity wall' and 'NRSRO' is consistent throughout, and the connection between capital allocation and EPS accretion is clearly articulated, but the foundational data alignment is flawed.",
