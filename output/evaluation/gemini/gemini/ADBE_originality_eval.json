    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, functioning primarily as a recap of Adobe's Q2 FY25 earnings release and a restatement of management's public narrative. Every identified insight is either a direct restatement of company disclosures (e.g., the $125M AI ARR run-rate, the new supplemental segment reporting) or a generic application of standard financial analysis (e.g., P/E vs. historical averages). The 'Economic Moat' section is a textbook application of Morningstar's framework without any company-specific interpretive value beyond what is publicly available. Furthermore, the valuation section utilizes a boilerplate DCF model with standard assumptions (WACC, terminal growth) and lacks any novel drivers or unique mechanisms. Per the decision rules, the absence of any clear synthesis or original thesis, combined with the fact that all insights are generic or restated, necessitates a 'Poor' grade. The report offers no decision-relevant perspective that a reader could not obtain from a basic news summary or the company's own investor relations materials.",
