    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally sound and covers all required headline sections, including a detailed valuation bridge and a robust ESG analysis. However, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to several critical omissions and structural weaknesses. Most significantly, the Financials Snapshot table lacks at least three core sector-specific KPIs: Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), Switched Transactions, and Cross-border Volume Growth. While some of these are mentioned in the text, their absence from the multi-year forecast table triggers a hard cap of 'Fair' per the instruction. Additionally, the report lacks a formal peer benchmarking section or table (e.g., comparing Mastercard's margins and multiples to Visa or American Express) and provides no scenario or sensitivity analysis for the DCF valuation. There is also significant redundancy; the acquisition of Recorded Future and the specific $3.2 billion capital return figure are repeated across the Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and Capital Allocation sections with minimal additional depth in subsequent mentions, which warrants a level downgrade. While the evidence integration is consistent, these gaps in quantitative depth and comparative context limit the report's comprehensiveness.",
