        "grade": "Poor",
        "summary_reasoning": "The report initially appears robust, providing explicit assumptions and quantified scenario analysis. However, it fails the consistency and justification pillars due to multiple major internal contradictions. First, there is a significant numeric discrepancy: the narrative claims a Price/Sales ratio 'exceeding 24x,' while the summary table and the report's own market cap/revenue data ($103B/$4.78B) clearly indicate ~21.5x. Second, the report contains a fundamental methodological contradiction in its WACC calculation. The author calculates a 9.87% cost of capital but adjusts it downward to 8.9% to account for 'High Uncertainty' and 'execution risk.' In standard financial theory, higher risk and uncertainty require a higher discount rate; lowering the rate to reflect risk is a logical failure that artificially inflates the valuation. Third, the report notes that GAAP operating losses 'widened dramatically' to $(113)M due to the 2024 outage and 'elongated sales cycles,' yet the DCF assumes GAAP margins will reach 'high single digits' by the end of the period without providing a specific bridge or causal driver for this reversal. Per the hard caps in the instructions, two or more distinct contradictions mandate a 'Poor' grade.",
