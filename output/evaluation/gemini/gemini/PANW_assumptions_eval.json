    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to multiple severe internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis, triggering several 'Hard Cap' rules. While the report explicitly states key drivers\u2014such as a 9.5% WACC, 3.5% terminal growth, and specific FY25 guidance for NGS ARR and FCF margins\u2014these inputs are undermined by mathematical and logical failures. Specifically, Table 3 (Sum-of-the-Parts) contains a glaring calculation error, stating a 'Total EV' of ~$10.8 Billion despite the individual segments summing to $115.6 Billion. Furthermore, the report presents a logical impossibility regarding share count: it cites a current market cap of ~$123.8 Billion (implying ~650 million shares at $190.52) but then estimates a post-merger share count of only ~450 million. This occurs despite the $25 billion CyberArk acquisition being funded partially with stock, which should increase the share count, not reduce it by 200 million. Justification for long-term inputs like WACC and terminal growth is minimal, lacking ties to specific risk-free rates or peer benchmarks. Finally, the report fails the requirement for sensitivity analysis; while it mentions qualitative bull/bear cases for the upcoming quarter, it provides no quantified ranges or valuation impacts for its primary model drivers (WACC, margins, or synergies). These flaws render the model's outputs internally inconsistent and auditable only as a 'black box'.",
