    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits exceptional narrative flow and structural integration, particularly in the Analyst Note where it proactively addresses the 'narrative disconnect' between massive AI-related capital expenditures and near-term free cash flow (FCF) pressure. The author successfully links the $100 billion capex cycle to the physical capacity constraints in power availability for AWS data centers, providing a logical bridge between the Bear case (FCF pressure) and the Bull case (AI leadership). Furthermore, the Valuation section is tightly coupled with the Business Strategy, explicitly citing the high-margin Advertising and AWS segments as the primary drivers for the forecasted expansion of operating margins to 15% over the next decade. Terminology is used with high precision, and the Bulls/Bears arguments are thoroughly reconciled with the HOLD rating.\n\nDespite these strengths, the report is subject to a mandatory downgrade to 'fair' due to significant temporal inaccuracies. The Cover Block identifies the 'Current Price' as of June 2025, yet the Analyst Note incorporates Q2 2025 financial results which were not released until July 31, 2025 (per Source 52). Additionally, the ESG Risk section and the Sources list cite data and access dates from September 2025. This internal contradiction regarding the report's effective date\u2014claiming to be written in June while utilizing data from July and September\u2014violates the requirement for temporal alignment and triggers the guardrail cap.",

        "The 'Current Price (Jun-2025)' on the Cover Block is time-inaccurate relative to the inclusion of Q2 2025 results released July 31, 2025 (Source 52) and ESG data from September 2025 (Section 12).",
        "The Analyst Note (Section 3) provides seamless connective tissue by reconciling the $100B capex cycle with AWS capacity constraints and long-term AI strategy.",
        "Valuation assumptions (Section 8) are explicitly cross-referenced with the 'increasing mix of high-margin AWS and Advertising revenue' detailed in the Strategy section."
