    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s quality of assumptions is graded as Fair. While the analyst provides explicit terminal valuation inputs (WACC of 10.5% and Terminal Growth of 2.5%) and specific synergy targets ($1.2B and $1.3B by 2027), the fundamental operational drivers remain largely opaque. The report identifies Net Interest Margin (NIM) and Credit Provisions as critical profit drivers, yet it fails to provide specific forward-looking estimates or quantified sensitivities for either. The 'Financials Snapshot' table is particularly weak, containing 'insufficient data' for nearly all line items in the 2025E and 2026E periods, including NII, Provisions, and Efficiency Ratios. This creates a 'black-box' effect where the projected $18.90 Adjusted EPS for 2026 cannot be reconciled or audited against its component drivers.\n\nJustification is partial; while the WACC is attributed to a CAPM model, the underlying variables (Beta, Risk-Free Rate) are omitted. Furthermore, the report lacks quantified scenario analysis for the most material risks\u2014credit deterioration and synergy slippage\u2014providing only a standard valuation sensitivity matrix. A significant internal inconsistency exists in the 'Financials Snapshot,' where FY 2024 revenue is reported as $39.1B, a $10B decline from FY 2023 that contradicts the narrative of a stable pre-merger business and the Q1 2025 run rate. These gaps in explicitness, traceability, and stress-testing of operational levers prevent a higher grade.",
