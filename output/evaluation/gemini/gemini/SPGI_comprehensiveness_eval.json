    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a structurally sound overview of S&P Global, covering all mandatory sections from the Analyst Note to ESG considerations. It excels in qualitative depth, particularly regarding the strategic rationale for the S&P Global Mobility spin-off and the competitive advantages of the 'Big Three' ratings oligopoly. However, the report is constrained by several critical omissions that trigger hard caps on the grading scale. Most notably, the Financials Snapshot is generic; it lacks essential sector-specific KPIs such as retention rates for the Market Intelligence segment, Assets Under Management (AUM) for the Indices segment, and debt issuance volume trends for the Ratings segment. While these are mentioned qualitatively in the text, their absence from the multi-year financial table limits the report's quantitative rigor. Additionally, the report lacks a formal peer benchmarking section and any form of scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., bull/bear cases or WACC/growth sensitivity tables). There is also significant redundancy, as the Mobility divestiture is repeated across nearly every section with minimal incremental insight. These gaps in peer context, sector-specific data visualization, and the lack of sensitivity modeling, combined with repetitive narrative structures, result in a 'Fair' grade despite the strong prose.",
