    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates significant analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive summaries to provide clear causal reasoning for Amazon's performance. It effectively links the 'regionalized model' to a lower 'cost-to-serve per unit' and identifies 'physical capacity limitations' as the primary constraint on AWS growth rather than a lack of demand. The analyst provides explicit, quantified assumptions for the DCF valuation, including a 'WACC of 10.3%' and a '5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 9.5%,' both of which are benchmarked against industry standards or consensus. The report also identifies structural shifts, noting the 'high-margin advertising business' acts as a 'high-margin tailwind' to consolidated results. While the report includes a 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' framework and a dedicated risk section to address uncertainty, it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based valuation ranges. There is no exploration of how the $245 fair value estimate would fluctuate if key drivers, such as AI-related capital expenditures or AWS growth rates, deviated from the base case. According to the decision rules, the presence of benchmarked assumptions and causal mechanisms without quantified scenario analysis results in a grade of 'Good.'",
