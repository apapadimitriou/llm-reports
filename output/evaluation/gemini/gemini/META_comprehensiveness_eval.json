    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a detailed narrative on Meta's AI pivot and regulatory environment but fails on structural comprehensiveness and efficiency. Most critically, the Financials Snapshot is generic, omitting essential sector-specific KPIs such as Daily Active Users (DAU), Monthly Active Users (MAU), and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), which are fundamental to evaluating an ad-tech business. Per the grading rubric, the omission of two or more core sector KPIs in the financial summary caps the grade at 'Fair.' Furthermore, the report exhibits significant redundancy; the 'depreciation bomb' and the specific 2025 capital expenditure guidance ($66B\u2013$72B) are repeated across the Executive Summary, Q2 Preview, AI Imperative, and Financial Model sections without introducing incremental depth or new analytical angles. This repetitive nature triggers a mandatory one-level downgrade from the capped 'Fair' status. While the report includes a robust ESG analysis and peer benchmarking, these strengths are offset by the lack of a formal scenario or sensitivity analysis table. The combination of missing core operational data in the financial summary and the high level of internal repetition results in a 'Poor' grade for comprehensiveness.",
