    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions assessment due to multiple internal numeric contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While assumptions are explicit and specific regarding magnitudes and time horizons, they fail the consistency and justification pillars. Most critically, the report contains three distinct contradictions: 1) The Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) is stated as 3.7% in the text and model, yet the report\u2019s own cited source (#11) explicitly states the SCB is expected to decrease to 2.5%. 2) The financial estimates table forecasts a year-over-year revenue decline for 2025 ($82.60B to $81.90B), which directly conflicts with the narrative claim that NII (the bank's primary revenue driver) will grow 1-3% in 2025. 3) The Cost of Equity (Ke) is inconsistently applied as 9.5% in the summary and 9.75% in the detailed calculation, leaving the final valuation auditable trail broken. Furthermore, despite identifying material risks such as Commercial Real Estate (CRE) exposure and interest rate volatility, the analyst provides no quantified sensitivity tables or scenario-based valuation ranges. Per the 'Hard Caps' in the instruction, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions, combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities, necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
