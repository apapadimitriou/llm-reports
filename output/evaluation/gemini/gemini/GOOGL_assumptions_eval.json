    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s assumptions are highly explicit and well-justified, yet the lack of robust sensitivity analysis limits the grade to 'Fair.' Key valuation inputs, including a WACC of 8.5% (detailed by risk-free rate, beta, and ERP) and a terminal growth rate of 2.75%, are clearly stated and proximal to the DCF model. Operational drivers, such as the $75 billion FY2025 capital expenditure guidance and the 12.7% revenue growth forecast, are specific and directly tied to management commentary and recent Q1 2025 performance. Internal consistency is a notable strength; there are no numeric contradictions between the narrative, the historical summary tables, and the DCF summary.\n\nHowever, the report fails the 'Good' criteria due to insufficient stress-testing. While it acknowledges that the valuation is sensitive to WACC and terminal growth, it only provides a single quantified sensitivity point (a 50-bps increase in WACC). It offers no quantified ranges or scenarios for other material drivers like revenue growth, operating margins, or the massive CapEx step-up, which the report itself identifies as a primary risk to free cash flow. Without quantified scenarios for at least 2\u20133 material drivers or a sensitivity matrix, the outputs remain somewhat 'black-box' regarding operational volatility. Consequently, per the instruction's hard caps on sensitivity analysis, the report cannot exceed a 'Fair' rating.",
