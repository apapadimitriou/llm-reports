{
    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to multiple significant internal numeric contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis for the valuation. First, there is a major mathematical error in the Cost of Equity calculation: the report cites a 4.2% risk-free rate, a 1.05 beta, and a 5.0% equity risk premium to arrive at an 8.2% Cost of Equity, whereas the actual CAPM formula (4.2 + 1.05 * 5.0) results in 9.45%. Second, the stated 7.8% revenue CAGR for 2025\u20132029 is inconsistent with the financial table, which shows revenue growing from $14.21B to $20.90B, representing an 8.0% CAGR. \n\nBeyond these contradictions, the report fails the stress-testing requirement. While it provides a single-point sensitivity for issuance volumes and EPS, it offers no quantified ranges or scenarios for the Fair Value Estimate ($595). There is no sensitivity matrix for WACC or terminal growth, and the bull/bear cases are entirely qualitative. Per the hard caps in the instructions, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions, combined with the absence of quantified valuation sensitivities, mandates a 'Poor' grade. While the assumptions are explicitly listed and specific, they lack the internal coherence and robustness required for a higher rating.",
