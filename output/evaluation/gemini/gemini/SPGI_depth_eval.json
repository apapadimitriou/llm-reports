    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high analytical depth by moving beyond description to explain the 'why' behind its forecasts. It identifies the 'maturity wall' as a causal driver for the Ratings revenue floor and explains the 'mathematical lift' to margins resulting from the Mobility spin-off. Assumptions are clearly stated and benchmarked, such as the terminal growth rate tied to nominal GDP and WACC components linked to 10-year Treasury yields. The report includes quantified sensitivities, noting that a '10% increase in issuance volumes translates to roughly a 3-4% increase in total EPS' and a '20% bear market correction would immediately reduce asset-based fees.' The report provides actionable implications by linking the Mobility divestiture to a specific re-rating thesis, arguing the market 'discounts the execution risk... excessively.' It effectively uses data to support its 'Wide Moat' rating, citing retention rates 'exceeding 95%' as evidence of switching costs. However, it falls short of an 'Excellent' grade because it lacks a comprehensive scenario analysis or a sensitivity matrix that shows how the Fair Value Estimate ($595) would fluctuate under different macro conditions. While it identifies risks, it does not quantify their impact on the final valuation, providing only a single-point estimate rather than a range of outcomes or a Bull/Bear valuation bridge.",
