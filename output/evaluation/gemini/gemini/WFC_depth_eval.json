    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high analytical depth by linking the regulatory catalyst of asset cap removal to specific balance sheet mechanisms, such as the ability to \"replace high-cost wholesale funding with lower-cost corporate operational deposits.\" It provides explicit, quantified valuation assumptions, such as \"Cost of Equity (Ke): 9.5% (Beta 1.1, Risk-Free Rate 4.25%),\" and benchmarks WFC\u2019s valuation against peers using a regression where \"100bps of ROTCE typically commands ~0.15x turns of TBV.\" The inference quality is strong, particularly in the \"Excess Capital Bridge,\" which uses DFAST results to quantify the $17.3B in surplus capital supporting the $40B buyback. However, while the report identifies critical risks like CRE exposure, noting \"ACL for CRE Office was $2.1 billion, or 7.9%,\" it lacks a formal quantified sensitivity analysis or multi-scenario model (e.g., Bull/Bear EPS outcomes based on rate shifts). The implications are actionable and conditional, noting that \"if rates fall too quickly... asset sensitivity becomes a liability.\" The use of three distinct valuation methodologies provides a range of outcomes, but the lack of stress-tested operational scenarios prevents an \"Excellent\" grade.",
