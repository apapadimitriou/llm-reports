    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, covering nearly all required sections including a detailed Analyst Note, Business Description, and a robust Competitive Positioning analysis against Databricks. It excels in evidence integration, utilizing 17 distinct citations to support financial and strategic claims. Sector-specific KPIs for SaaS (NRR, RPO, and customer cohort growth) are clearly presented and integrated into the narrative. The valuation section provides an explicit link between the 28% revenue growth driver and the 14x EV/Revenue multiple. However, the report fails to achieve an 'Excellent' grade due to the total absence of scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., Bull/Bear cases or a WACC/Growth sensitivity matrix). Additionally, while the 'AI Pivot' is discussed with increasing depth, there is minor redundancy across the Executive Summary and Analyst Note. A formal glossary is also missing, though most technical terms are defined in-text.",
