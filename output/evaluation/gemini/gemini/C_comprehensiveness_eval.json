    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally sound, covering all required sections from an executive summary to a detailed risk analysis. It provides a clear valuation bridge linking RoTCE targets and TBVPS to the price target, and includes a useful peer benchmarking table. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to several deficiencies. First, the Financials Snapshot is incomplete, missing core banking KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM) and Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratios, and contains significant data gaps for historical years (2022\u20132023) where Net Income, EPS, and CET1 ratios are partially omitted. Second, there is notable redundancy; the discussion of the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) and the 'five core businesses' is repeated across the Investment Thesis, Strategic Transformation, and Segment Deep Dive sections without adding incremental depth. Finally, the report lacks any scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., interest rate sensitivity or bull/bear valuation cases), which is expected for an 'Excellent' or 'Good' rating. While the sourcing is consistent and the qualitative analysis is strong, the combination of missing sector-specific quantitative metrics and repetitive narrative structure necessitates a 'Fair' grade under the strict evaluation criteria.",
