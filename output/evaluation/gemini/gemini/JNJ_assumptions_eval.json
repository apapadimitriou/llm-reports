        "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the consistency and auditability standards due to multiple material contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables. First, the text explicitly states a five-year revenue CAGR of 4.5%, yet the data provided in Table 4 (Financial Model Summary) results in a calculated CAGR of 5.25% from 2024 to 2029. Second, the narrative forecasts adjusted operating margins in the 25-26% range, while Table 4 consistently lists a margin of 27.5% for all projected years (2025E-2029E). These discrepancies represent unresolved numeric contradictions that trigger a hard cap on the grade. Furthermore, while the report provides a WACC breakdown, the justification is weak; it cites a post-tax cost of debt (9.52%) that is significantly higher than the cost of equity (7.98%), which is counter-intuitive for a highly-rated entity like Johnson & Johnson and lacks supporting context. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is limited to point-estimate scenarios (Bull/Base/Bear) rather than a robust, quantified sensitivity matrix (e.g., WACC vs. Terminal Growth) that shows the impact of incremental changes in material drivers. Because there are at least two distinct contradictions between the text and the tables, the report is graded as Poor.",
