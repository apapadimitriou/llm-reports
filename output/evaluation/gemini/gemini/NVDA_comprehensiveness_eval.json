    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required structural sections and provides a clear valuation bridge, specifically linking the reversal of the China export ban and the Blackwell architecture ramp to the revised fair value estimate. However, it is capped at 'Fair' due to several critical omissions and structural weaknesses. The Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks essential semiconductor sector KPIs, specifically inventory levels/turns and a breakdown of segment-level revenue and margins within the data table. While peer benchmarking is present for ESG metrics, it is entirely absent for financial valuation and growth comparisons, leaving the DCF analysis without industry context. Furthermore, despite assigning a 'Very High' uncertainty rating, the report fails to provide any scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., bull/bear cases or WACC/growth matrices). Finally, the report exhibits significant redundancy; the China policy shift and Blackwell production ramp are repeated across the Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and Valuation sections with minimal incremental depth, which triggers a mandatory downgrade under the evaluation rules.",
