        "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet the minimum standards for high-quality assumptions due to a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis and internal numeric inconsistencies. While the report is explicit in stating its primary valuation inputs\u2014such as a 8.5% WACC, 3.5% terminal growth rate, and a 5-year revenue decay model\u2014it provides no stress-testing or scenario analysis. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities on material drivers automatically caps the grade at 'Fair.' However, the report further contains a distinct numeric contradiction: the financial forecast table (Table 3) models a consistent 46.0% non-GAAP operating margin for FY2025\u20132027, whereas the DCF analysis (Section 6.1) explicitly assumes a 'stable long-term non-GAAP operating margin of 45%.' This discrepancy between the narrative/valuation section and the summary financial tables represents an unresolved internal contradiction. According to the decision rules, the combination of no quantified sensitivities and at least one numeric contradiction necessitates a 'Poor' grade. Furthermore, while the WACC is cited from third-party providers, there is no independent build-up or justification for the 3.5% terminal growth rate, which is aggressive for a mature software firm. The lack of a projected share count despite a massive $25 billion buyback program also leaves a material driver of the EPS forecast opaque and unquantified.",
