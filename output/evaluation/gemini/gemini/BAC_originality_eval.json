    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique investment thesis, relying entirely on public headlines, management guidance, and consensus data. All identified insights are either direct restatements of recent news\u2014such as the 8% dividend increase and the 2025 Federal Reserve stress test results\u2014or generic sector-wide observations regarding macroeconomic uncertainty and commercial real estate (CRE) risks. The report explicitly states that its DCF model uses a 'long-term earnings growth rate of 7.0%... consistent with consensus analyst estimates,' confirming a lack of independent or novel valuation drivers. There is no attempt to link disparate data points (e.g., specific deposit beta trajectories or efficiency ratio targets) into a proprietary conclusion. The 'Responsible Growth' framework discussed is a verbatim repetition of Bank of America's own corporate marketing. Because the report contains zero original syntheses or theses and relies on at least six generic or paraphrased insights, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the mandatory decision rules.",
