    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet the minimum threshold for originality, functioning primarily as a summary of IQVIA's Q1 and Q2 2025 earnings press releases. It contains zero original syntheses or unique theses. Every 'insight' provided\u2014such as the $31.5 billion backlog providing visibility or the TAS segment's growth reflecting demand\u2014is a direct restatement of public headlines or company-provided guidance. The valuation section is particularly weak, utilizing a boilerplate DCF model with a generic 5% revenue CAGR and margin expansion attributed vaguely to 'scale efficiencies' without any company-specific mechanism or quantified driver. There is no interpretive commentary linking macro trends, specific therapeutic area shifts, or peer performance to IQVIA's specific trajectory. The 'EPS bridge' is merely a mathematical restatement of the author's own assumptions rather than a synthesis of external data. Consequently, the report offers no decision-relevant value beyond what is already available in the cited IR materials.",
