    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the comprehensiveness test primarily due to the complete absence of historical financial data (marked as 'insufficient data' for 2022\u20132024) and the omission of critical banking sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot. While the report structure includes all required sections, the content is highly repetitive; the 'asset cap removal' and 'dividend hike' are used as the primary substance across nearly every section (Analyst Note, Strategy, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation) without adding incremental depth. This redundancy triggers a mandatory downgrade. Furthermore, the Financials Snapshot lacks core banking metrics such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), CET1 ratio, and Loan Loss Provisions, which are essential for a bank of this scale. The absence of peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis further limits the report's scope. Although a valuation bridge is attempted, it is skeletal and lacks the necessary operating detail to be considered comprehensive. The combination of missing historical data, missing sector KPIs, and high redundancy results in a 'Poor' grade.",
