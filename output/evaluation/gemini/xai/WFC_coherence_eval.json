    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report suffers from a critical temporal misalignment; it is dated June 29, 2025, yet it discusses Q2 2025 earnings results and cites sources from July and August 2025, making the narrative chronologically impossible. Furthermore, there is a significant internal contradiction within the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section. The narrative provides an EPS bridge starting from a 2024 base of $5.61, adding $0.50 and $0.30 while subtracting $0.20, which mathematically results in $6.21. However, the text immediately claims this yields a 2029 EPS of $7.50, which is the figure used in the Financials Snapshot table. This $1.29 discrepancy is never explained. While the report maintains a standard structure, the transitions between the Analyst Note and the specific segment analyses are thin. The 'Bears Say' point regarding Net Interest Income (NII) pressure is noted but not reconciled with the valuation's assumption of significant margin expansion to 28%. These logical and temporal failures require the reader to reconstruct the argument, fitting the 'poor' rubric. The reliance on future-dated sources (e.g., Source [5] from August 2025) for a June report further undermines the credibility and coherence of the document.",
