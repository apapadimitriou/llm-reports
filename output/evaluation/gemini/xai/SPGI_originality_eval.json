    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying entirely on restating public information and boilerplate industry narratives. Every insight identified is either a direct restatement of cited news sources (e.g., Q2 EPS growth from Motley Fool, FCF forecasts from social media) or a generic description of the company's market position (e.g., the 'near-duopoly' in ratings). There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points to form a new conclusion; for instance, the margin expansion to 45% is presented as a flat assumption rather than a derived result of specific operational changes. The valuation section is standard and lacks any novel drivers or mechanisms, using a basic EPS bridge and linear CAGR projections. Because the report contains zero original syntheses or testable, non-obvious theses, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the mandatory decision rules.",
