    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report suffers from a critical temporal paradox that undermines its entire coherence and credibility. The document is dated July 2, 2025, yet the Analyst Note and subsequent sections provide detailed analysis of Q2 2025 earnings results and cite sources (CNBC, Yahoo Finance) dated July 16 and July 20, 2025. This impossible chronology means the report claims to analyze data and earnings calls that had not yet occurred or been published at the time of the report's stated issuance. Beyond this temporal failure, there are significant internal contradictions regarding Net Interest Income (NII). The Analyst Note states that NII 'fell short' and 'missed estimates' due to the interest rate environment. However, the 'Bulls Say' section explicitly claims that 'High interest rates support net interest income,' creating an unresolved tension between the bull case and the actual reported results described in the lead note. While the financial table and the valuation assumptions are mathematically consistent\u2014for instance, the 3.5% revenue CAGR aligns with the 2024\u20132025 forecast jump\u2014the narrative flow is fundamentally broken by these logical and chronological lapses. The report fails to reconcile how a 'miss' in NII leads to a bullish projection of NII support from the same rate environment, forcing the reader to assemble a coherent argument themselves.",
