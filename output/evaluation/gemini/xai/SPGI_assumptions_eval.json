    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions criteria primarily due to significant internal numeric contradictions and a lack of auditable historical data. While the report explicitly lists key drivers such as revenue CAGR (8%), terminal growth (4%), and target operating margins (45%), these inputs are not supported by the provided evidence. Specifically, the 'Financials Snapshot' table contains 'insufficient data' for all historical years (2022\u20132024), yet the narrative makes specific claims about 2024 performance (e.g., 42% operating margin and $10.50 EPS) that cannot be verified within the document. \n\nMost critically, the report contains a blatant internal contradiction regarding its valuation: the Analyst Note claims a $550 fair value implies a 30x forward P/E, whereas the Fair Value section correctly calculates that $550 divided by the $12.00 EPS forecast is a 46x P/E. This discrepancy, combined with a minor conflict between the text ($20B revenue by 2029) and the table ($20.2B), violates the consistency requirement. Furthermore, while the report mentions a generic \u00b120% fair value sensitivity, it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis for specific material drivers like WACC or margin fluctuations. Per the decision rules, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions and the absence of robust, driver-based sensitivity analysis necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
