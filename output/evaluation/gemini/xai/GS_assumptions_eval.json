    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report receives a 'Poor' grade due to the combination of internal numeric contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key drivers such as a 4% revenue CAGR, a 9% WACC, and a 3% terminal growth rate, these inputs are weakly justified. The analyst admits to having 'insufficient data' for historical actuals (2022\u20132024), making the forward-looking projections lack a credible baseline or historical context. A clear internal contradiction exists regarding operating margins: the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section specifies a 30% average, the Appendix table cites 30.5%, and the 'Financials Snapshot' table presents a sequence (30.0% to 31.0%) that averages 30.7%. This inconsistency undermines the auditability of the model. Furthermore, the report fails the sensitivity requirement; it merely offers a qualitative statement that valuation could swing by \u00b120% without providing a quantified matrix or scenario analysis for material levers like interest rates or trading revenue. According to the decision rules, the presence of a numeric contradiction combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities triggers a mandatory 'Poor' rating.",
