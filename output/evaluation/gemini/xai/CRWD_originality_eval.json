    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is almost entirely a restatement of the Q1 FY2026 earnings release and standard market commentary. It fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis. Every 'insight' presented is either a direct data point from the company's financial results (e.g., $1.1B revenue, $3.2B Falcon Flex value) or a generic sector observation (e.g., competition from Microsoft, market growth driven by cyber threats). The valuation section is a boilerplate DCF that uses standard revenue CAGR and WACC assumptions without introducing any novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. There is no interpretive commentary that goes beyond the cited sources, and the 'Bulls/Bears' section simply recycles reported metrics. Because the report lacks even a single weak synthesis or original thesis, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",
