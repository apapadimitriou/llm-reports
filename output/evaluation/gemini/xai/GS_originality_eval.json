    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report primarily functions as a summary of specific data points extracted from the provided sources, particularly the Q2 2025 earnings results. It identifies key performance metrics, such as the 71% surge in advisory fees and the $40 billion buyback authorization, but fails to provide original interpretive commentary. The insights are largely restatements of public headlines (e.g., de-risking alternative investments, FICC misses). While the analyst attempts a synthesis through an 'EPS bridge' and a moat analysis, these are weak and rely on generic assumptions like a 4% revenue CAGR and 30% operating margins without explaining the underlying company-specific mechanisms. The valuation section is boilerplate, lacking any novel drivers or unique catalysts. Because more than three insights are restated from sources and the valuation lacks a novel mechanism, the report is capped at 'Fair' per the grading instructions.",
