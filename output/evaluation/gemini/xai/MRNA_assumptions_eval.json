    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to multiple severe internal contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key assumptions such as revenue CAGR, WACC, and terminal growth, these figures are fundamentally inconsistent with the provided financial data. Specifically, the narrative and appendix claim a -5% revenue CAGR from 2025\u20132029, yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table shows revenue growing from $2.0 billion to $6.5 billion over that same period\u2014a positive CAGR of approximately 34%. Furthermore, the text forecasts '10% growth post-2026,' but the table reflects annual growth rates exceeding 40% for 2027 and 2028. These unresolved numeric conflicts between the narrative and the tables violate the core requirement for internal consistency. Justification for critical inputs like the 10.5% WACC and 3.0% terminal growth rate is weak, relying on generic industry averages rather than company-specific data or cited market yields. Finally, the report fails the stress-testing requirement; although it mentions a vague \u00b130% sensitivity range for the fair value estimate and a potential 20% revenue downside, it provides no quantified scenario analysis or sensitivity matrix showing how changes in material drivers (e.g., launch timing or discount rates) impact the valuation. Per the decision rules, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions combined with the absence of robust sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
