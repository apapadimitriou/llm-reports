    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report earns a 'Fair' grade due to a combination of clearly stated primary valuation inputs and significant gaps in sensitivity analysis and internal consistency. On the positive side, the report is explicit regarding its WACC (9%), terminal growth (3%), and revenue CAGR (5%), providing specific components like the risk-free rate and beta. However, the justification for these figures is thin, relying almost exclusively on Q2 2025 trends to project a five-year horizon without deep historical context or peer benchmarking.\n\nA critical weakness is the internal inconsistency regarding 2024 data; the Financials Snapshot table labels 2024 as 'insufficient data,' yet the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' text utilizes specific 2024 baselines ($5.50 EPS and 25% margin) to build its forecast bridge. Furthermore, while the report qualitatively mentions that net interest margin (NIM) compression or operational risks could swing the valuation by 15-20%, it fails to provide a quantified sensitivity table or scenario analysis showing how specific changes in material drivers (like interest rates or credit costs) would alter the $70 fair value estimate. Finally, for a diversified bank, the omission of explicit credit cost/provision assumptions is a notable gap in the modeling of material drivers. These factors prevent the report from achieving a 'Good' rating.",
