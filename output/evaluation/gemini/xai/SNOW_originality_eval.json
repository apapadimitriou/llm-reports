    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original analysis, synthesis, or unique thesis. It functions primarily as a summary of data points extracted from social media posts (X/Twitter) and earnings transcripts, without adding interpretive value. Every identified insight is a restatement of public financial results (revenue growth, customer counts, retention rates) or a generic observation about the sector (AI trends, cloud migration). The report explicitly admits to having 'insufficient data' for critical sections including the Economic Moat, Capital Allocation, and the entire Financials Snapshot. Furthermore, the valuation section is entirely boilerplate, utilizing standard placeholder assumptions (10% WACC, 4% terminal growth) and arbitrary revenue/margin targets rather than company-specific drivers. There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points to form a new conclusion, resulting in zero decision relevance for an investor beyond what is available in a basic news headline.",
