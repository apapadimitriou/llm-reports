    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions assessment primarily due to significant internal contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key drivers such as revenue CAGR (12%), operating margins (57.8% average), and WACC (8.5%), these inputs are undermined by conflicting data points. Specifically, the Analyst Note cites a 2026 EPS forecast of $15.90, whereas the Financials Snapshot table explicitly lists 2026 EPS as $17.20. Furthermore, the Fair Value section claims the $510 estimate reflects a 33x forward P/E on 2026 estimates, which mathematically implies an EPS of $15.45, creating a three-way discrepancy. \n\nRegarding justification and specificity, the report provides market-based inputs for WACC (risk-free rate, ERP, beta) and aligns terminal growth with GDP expectations, which is a strength. However, it fails the 'Stress-tested' pillar. While the Risk section qualitatively mentions that earnings could swing by 15-20% due to regulatory or macro factors, there is no quantified sensitivity table or scenario analysis demonstrating how changes in material drivers (like WACC, terminal growth, or margin compression) would impact the $510 Fair Value Estimate. Per the grading instructions, the combination of a material numeric contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
