    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report earns an \"Excellent\" grade by providing a comprehensive analytical framework that links operational drivers to financial outcomes with high precision. It features \"mechanism-rich reasoning,\" such as the detailed explanation of how \"Skyrizi and Rinvoq... [are] offsetting Humira declines.\" The report excels in inference quality, providing a quantified EPS bridge for 2025 that breaks down growth into specific components: \"add $0.50 from revenue growth, subtract $0.20 from margin pressure.\" Data use is robust, with explicit valuation assumptions including a \"WACC is 7.0%, reflecting a beta of 0.6\" and a terminal growth rate of 2.0%, with the P/E multiple \"aligned with peer averages.\" Furthermore, the report includes multiple quantified ranges and scenarios, such as a \"valuation sensitivity of \u00b120% to revenue assumptions\" and an uncertainty-driven \"fair value range \u00b120-30%.\" It also quantifies specific risks, noting that \"over 50% of value [is] tied to late-stage assets.\" The implications are actionable and conditional, advising that \"investors should monitor Q2 results for confirmation\" of the pipeline's performance. This combination of causal depth, benchmarked data, and quantified sensitivity analysis meets the highest standard of analytical depth.",
