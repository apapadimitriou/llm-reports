    "summary_reasoning": "The report earns a 'Good' grade for its clear causal reasoning and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. It effectively links the regulatory milestone of the 'lifting of the asset cap' to the ability to 'pursue growth' and 'boost net interest income.' The analytical depth is bolstered by a quantified EPS bridge that breaks down value drivers: 'adding $0.50 from revenue growth' and '$0.30 from margin expansion.' Assumptions are transparently listed and benchmarked, such as 'Terminal Growth 2.5%... Long-term GDP proxy' and 'WACC 9.0%... Banking sector beta and rates.' While the report identifies significant risks and provides a general range for uncertainty\u2014noting that factors 'could swing valuation by 20-30%'\u2014it lacks a formal, quantified scenario analysis (e.g., specific Bull/Bear cases with adjusted inputs). The implications are actionable, providing a clear 'Fair-Value Estimate $65.00' and a 'buy recommendation.' However, the absence of detailed sensitivity tables or stress tests against specific macroeconomic variables (like interest rate shocks or credit loss spikes) prevents it from reaching the 'Excellent' tier.",
