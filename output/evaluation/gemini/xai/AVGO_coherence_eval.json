    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong structural organization and clear language, but it is undermined by significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the financial data. Most notably, the Analyst Note describes Q2 2025 operating margins as 'robust at 58%,' yet the Fair Value section and the Financials Snapshot table both project a much lower 2025 operating margin of 35%. This massive 2,300-basis-point gap is left entirely unexplained. Furthermore, the EPS bridge in the Fair Value section claims that margin expansion will add $0.50 to the 2025 EPS, but the Financials Snapshot table actually shows operating margins contracting from 36% in 2024 to 35% in 2025. There is also a mathematical mismatch regarding growth rates: the Strategy and Fair Value sections both claim a 15% revenue CAGR through 2029, but the table data calculates to a CAGR of only 10.3%. These discrepancies between the stated assumptions and the supporting tables force the reader to question the integrity of the $180 fair value estimate. Despite these flaws, the report excels in temporal accuracy and the Bulls/Bears sections are well-integrated into the broader thesis. However, the multiple unaddressed contradictions between the narrative, the EPS bridge, and the financial tables trigger a mandatory downgrade to fair.",
