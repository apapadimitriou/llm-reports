    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet the minimum standards for equity research assumptions, as nearly all material drivers are explicitly labeled as 'Insufficient data.' Regarding explicitness, the report lacks a functional model; key inputs such as WACC, terminal growth, tax rates, and operating margins are entirely absent. Justification is non-existent, as the report provides no multi-year historical context or peer benchmarking to support its qualitative claims. Specificity is extremely low, offering only a vague 'low-to-mid single-digit' revenue growth range without defined time horizons or causal magnitudes. While the text is internally consistent in its admission of data gaps, it fails the consistency requirement by providing a 'Hold' recommendation without a supporting valuation or EPS forecast. Most critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis; the report explicitly states that quantitative assessment is insufficient. This 'black-box' approach, where the Financials Snapshot and Key Valuation Assumptions Table are essentially empty, triggers the hard cap for opaque and unstated assumptions.",
