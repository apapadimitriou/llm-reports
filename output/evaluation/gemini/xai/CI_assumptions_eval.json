    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions, particularly regarding revenue CAGR (8%) and operating margins (4.5% target), which are clearly tabulated and proximal to the valuation narrative. Justification is solid, leveraging segment-level performance (10% growth in Evernorth vs. 6% in Cigna Healthcare) and historical 2024 benchmarks. Internal consistency is high; the EPS bridge ($28.29 to $29.00) and the multi-year financial snapshot reconcile perfectly with the narrative. However, the report fails to provide quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for its material drivers. While it mentions a general 'valuation swing of \u00b120%' under the Risk & Uncertainty section, it does not demonstrate how specific fluctuations in WACC, medical loss ratios, or margin expansion would numerically impact the fair value estimate. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers caps the grade at 'Fair.'",
