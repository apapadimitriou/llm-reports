    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides zero original synthesis or unique theses, failing the most basic requirements for originality. The content is almost entirely composed of restated headlines from Medtronic\u2019s fiscal 2025 press releases and generic sector-wide observations regarding aging populations and chronic diseases. The author explicitly acknowledges an inability to perform detailed analysis due to 'insufficient data,' resulting in a valuation section and financial snapshot filled with 'N/A' placeholders. There are no quantified drivers, no specific catalysts with timelines, and no interpretive commentary that goes beyond the company's own public statements. Because the report lacks any form of synthesis or decision-relevant insight, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the established decision rules.",
