    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Fair' because it fulfills the structural requirements of equity research but fails significantly on data depth and evidentiary standards. While all headline sections are present, including a functional valuation model and risk assessment, the report is subject to multiple hard caps. First, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits at least three critical sector-specific KPIs for a software/SaaS company: Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), Net Retention Rate (NRR), and Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). Although some figures are mentioned in the Analyst Note, their absence from the multi-year financial table triggers a 'Fair' cap. \n\nSecond, the report contains at least three material claims that are explicitly uncited or based on 'insufficient data' as admitted in the sources section (market share, industry growth rates, and ESG scores). This lack of consistent evidence integration further caps the grade at 'Fair'. Additionally, the report exhibits notable redundancy; the ARR and RPO growth statistics are repeated across the Analyst Note, Bulls Say, and Economic Moat sections with no additional depth or context. Finally, while the valuation links operating drivers to the fair value estimate, the absence of a peer benchmarking table and scenario/sensitivity analysis prevents the report from reaching a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating.",
