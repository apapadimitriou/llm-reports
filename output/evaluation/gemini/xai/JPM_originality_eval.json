    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying entirely on restating public headlines from the Q2 2025 earnings release and generic industry boilerplate. All identified insights are either direct paraphrases of cited news sources (CNBC, Reuters) or standard descriptions of JPMorgan's 'scale and diversification' that apply to any major bank. There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points to form a new conclusion; for example, the NII forecast raise is reported as a fact rather than analyzed through a unique lens of deposit beta or asset sensitivity. The valuation section is purely mechanical, using standard DCF assumptions and a generic P/E multiple without identifying a novel driver or specific catalyst. Consequently, the report offers zero value-add beyond what is already available in public filings and news summaries.",
