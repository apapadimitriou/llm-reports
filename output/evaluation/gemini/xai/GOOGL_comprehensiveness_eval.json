    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required structural sections, but fails to achieve a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade due to significant omissions in sector-specific KPIs and a major data error in the financials. While the report identifies Alphabet's core drivers (AI, Cloud, Search), the Financials Snapshot omits critical industry metrics such as Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), Cost Per Click (CPC), and Paid Clicks, which are essential for evaluating an advertising-heavy business. Furthermore, the 2024 revenue figure in the snapshot ($3580.0B) is a massive data error, being an order of magnitude higher than actual or projected figures, which undermines the evidence integration. The report also lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking table and a formal sensitivity/scenario analysis, providing only a vague percentage range for uncertainty. Redundancy is present, as the 'Analyst Note' and 'Business Strategy' sections repeat identical points regarding search market share and AI infrastructure without adding incremental depth. Consequently, the report meets the criteria for 'Fair' but is capped by the missing KPIs and lack of peer context.",
