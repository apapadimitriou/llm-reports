    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to explain the underlying drivers of Amazon's valuation. It provides clear causal links between strategic investments and financial outcomes, such as \"signaling potential margin pressure from investments in AI\" and the \"flywheel where more sellers attract more buyers.\" The valuation is supported by explicit, benchmarked assumptions, including a WACC of 8.0% (broken down by risk-free rate and equity risk premium) and a terminal growth rate of 4.0% justified as \"Long-term GDP plus inflation.\" The inclusion of an EPS bridge\u2014quantifying the impact of revenue growth (+$0.80) and capex (-$0.30)\u2014illustrates high-quality inference. However, the report fails to reach the 'Excellent' grade because it lacks a formal, quantified sensitivity analysis or multi-scenario valuation table. While it notes \"valuation swings of \u00b120% possible\" and mentions \"downside if AWS growth decelerates,\" it does not provide specific price targets or margin outcomes for alternative scenarios. The implications are actionable, advising that \"investors should monitor AI capital expenditures,\" but the lack of stress-testing for the 10% CAGR assumption limits the depth of the uncertainty analysis.",
