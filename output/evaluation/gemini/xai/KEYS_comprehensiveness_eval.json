    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all required headline sections and maintains consistent sourcing throughout. However, it is capped at 'Fair' due to significant omissions in sector-specific depth and the absence of scenario analysis. The Financials Snapshot is generic, lacking at least three critical sector KPIs for a test and measurement firm: Software/Services revenue mix, R&D intensity (as a line item), and Order/Backlog data. While the valuation section explicitly links revenue CAGR and margin expansion to the fair value estimate, it fails to provide a sensitivity analysis or a financial peer benchmarking table. Furthermore, there is notable redundancy; the Analyst Note repeats qualitative drivers (AI, 6G, and defense) found in the Strategy and Moat sections without providing additional granular detail. The lack of peer valuation context and the generic nature of the financial data prevent a higher grade.",
