    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits high analytical depth by providing a clear causal framework for its valuation. It moves beyond description to explain the mechanism for margin expansion, specifically citing 'cost savings from transformation (e.g., headcount reductions).' The inference quality is strong, evidenced by a detailed EPS bridge that quantifies the impact of revenue growth ($1.00) and margin expansion ($0.50). Assumptions are explicit and benchmarked, such as the terminal growth rate being a 'Long-term GDP proxy' and the WACC being decomposed into a '3% risk-free rate' and '6% equity risk premium.' The report also addresses uncertainty through quantified sensitivity analysis, noting that 'rate cuts reducing net interest margins by 5-10%' and that macro/regulatory risks 'could swing valuation by 15-20%.' These ranges, combined with a clear fair-value estimate of $70 and a comparison to peer forward P/E multiples (10x), provide actionable, conditional implications for investors. While the revenue CAGR is somewhat reliant on short-term trends, the overall integration of causal mechanisms, benchmarked assumptions, and quantified sensitivity meets the criteria for an Excellent grade.",
