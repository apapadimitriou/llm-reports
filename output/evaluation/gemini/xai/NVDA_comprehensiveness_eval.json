    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is a structural shell that lacks substantive content across nearly every critical dimension. While it includes the required headers, the majority of sections\u2014including Economic Moat, Capital Allocation, and ESG\u2014explicitly state 'insufficient data' rather than providing analysis. The Financials Snapshot is almost entirely empty, missing multi-year historical data, forward-looking estimates, and essential sector-specific KPIs such as R&D intensity, inventory metrics, or free cash flow. Furthermore, the valuation section fails to provide any internal modeling or linkage between operating drivers and the fair value estimate, instead relying on external analyst consensus. The reliance on social media ('X posts') for core financial metrics like EPS and Gross Margin is inappropriate for professional equity research and suggests a lack of verified evidence. With most expected sections being opaque or skeletal, the report fails to meet the basic requirements for comprehensiveness.",
