    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report receives a 'Poor' grade due to significant internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists four key valuation assumptions (Revenue CAGR, Operating Margin, WACC, and Terminal Growth) in an appendix table, these figures are directly contradicted by the 'Financials Snapshot' table, which labels all corresponding data points for FY 2025\u20132029 as 'insufficient.' This unresolved numeric conflict between the narrative's model inputs and the formal financial summary is a critical failure in consistency. Furthermore, the justification for these assumptions is exceptionally weak; the operating margin is described as an 'assumed expansion' despite 'insufficient data for actual,' and the WACC is dismissed as a 'standard for tech' without any company-specific risk assessment or link to current market yields. Most importantly, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers like revenue growth or margins, which triggers a hard cap on the grade. The lack of specific drivers for the 20% margin target and the absence of share count or tax rate assumptions render the valuation 'black-box' in nature, despite the appearance of a structured table.",
