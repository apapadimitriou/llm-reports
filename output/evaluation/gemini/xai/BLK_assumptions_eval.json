    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to multiple internal numeric contradictions and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report identifies key drivers such as revenue CAGR, WACC, and operating margins, these figures are inconsistent across different sections. For instance, the 2025 EPS is cited as $42.00 in the Analyst Note but $41.50 in the Fair Value section and Financials Snapshot. Similarly, the 2029 operating margin is stated as 38% in the narrative but 38.5% in the data table. A further discrepancy exists between the stated 8% AUM growth target in the strategy section and the 5% AUM growth figure used to drive the valuation model.\n\nJustification for these inputs is weak, relying on generic qualitative statements regarding 'secular trends' and 'scale' rather than multi-year historical comparisons or peer benchmarking. Most importantly, the report fails the mandatory requirement for stress-testing. Although it mentions a 'medium' uncertainty rating and a qualitative 20% valuation swing, it provides no quantified sensitivity tables or scenario analysis for material levers like interest rates, fee compression, or AUM flows. Per the grading instructions, the combination of two or more distinct contradictions and the lack of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' rating.",
