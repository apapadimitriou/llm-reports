    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions criteria due to multiple severe internal contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While key drivers like revenue growth (12% CAGR) and operating margins (33% by 2029) are explicitly stated, they are undermined by fundamental errors. First, there is a massive numeric contradiction in the 'Financials Snapshot' table, which lists 2024A revenue as $3,580 billion\u2014a figure ten times larger than the surrounding years and clearly a typo that invalidates the table's integrity. Second, the WACC calculation is mathematically incoherent: the report cites an 8.5% WACC based on a 6% risk-free rate, a 5% equity risk premium, and a 1.1 beta. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), these inputs should result in an 11.5% cost of equity/WACC, making the 8.5% figure an unjustified and contradictory plug. Furthermore, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers such as interest rates, margin compression, or revenue growth, offering only a vague qualitative mention of valuation swings related to regulatory risk. These two distinct numeric contradictions, combined with the absence of robust stress-testing, trigger a 'Poor' grade under the mandatory decision rules.",
