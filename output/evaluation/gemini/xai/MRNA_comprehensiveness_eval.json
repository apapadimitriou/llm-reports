    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Fair' because, while it includes all required headline sections, it suffers from significant internal contradictions and a lack of sector-specific depth. The Financials Snapshot is generic and omits at least two core biotechnology KPIs\u2014specifically R&D expenditure and a breakdown of product-specific revenue (e.g., Spikevax vs. pipeline)\u2014which triggers a hard cap at 'Fair.' Furthermore, the report contains blatant contradictions: the valuation narrative cites a -5% revenue CAGR and 10% post-2026 growth, yet the provided financial table shows a ~34% CAGR and annual growth rates exceeding 40%. The sourcing is also problematic, relying on 'Perplexity.ai' for financial forecasts and pipeline data rather than primary filings or reputable data providers. Proportionality is undermined by excessive redundancy; the '2028 cash breakeven' target is repeated across five different sections without incremental detail. Finally, the absence of a peer benchmarking table and detailed scenario analysis further limits the report's comprehensiveness, preventing it from achieving a 'Good' rating despite the presence of a valuation bridge and risk section.",
