    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows the required structural framework but fails significantly on data integrity, depth, and sector-specific rigor. While headline sections are present, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits all core sector KPIs (e.g., AWS revenue/growth, Advertising revenue, GMV) required for an Internet Retail and Cloud provider. The report is riddled with 'insufficient data' placeholders for critical metrics including Market Cap, Price/FVE, and 2024 actuals, which is unacceptable for a report dated June 2025. Furthermore, the report relies on a source from 2018 to support 2025 outlook claims regarding tariffs, representing a major failure in sourcing. Significant redundancy is observed, with the same data points regarding AWS and Advertising growth repeated across four sections (Analyst Note, Strategy, Bulls/Bears, and Moat) without incremental depth. The total absence of peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis, combined with the aforementioned data gaps and outdated citations, results in a 'Poor' grade.",
