    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails primarily on internal consistency and the lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While key drivers such as a 5% revenue CAGR and margin expansion to 25% are explicitly stated and proximal to the valuation narrative, the report contains severe, unresolved numeric contradictions. Specifically, the narrative cites a 2024 adjusted EPS of $11.13 and forecasts a 2025 EPS of $11.73, whereas the 'Financials Snapshot' table lists these figures as $7.49 and $7.87, respectively. This discrepancy between the valuation bridge and the summary financial data is a critical failure in internal coherence. Furthermore, the report lacks robust, quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers like WACC, terminal growth, or margins. It only provides a vague, qualitative mention of a '+/-20% swing' in the risk section without demonstrating how specific changes in inputs impact the $260 fair value estimate. According to the grading rubric, the combination of multiple distinct contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities mandates a 'Poor' grade.",
