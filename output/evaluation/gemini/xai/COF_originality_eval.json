    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying entirely on restating information from the 10-Q and generic industry boilerplate. All identified insights are either restatements of public financial results or generic sector-wide observations (e.g., 'scale in data analytics,' 'competition from fintech'). There are no specific catalysts, quantified peer comparisons, or non-obvious causal links. The valuation section uses standard DCF inputs (5% CAGR, 25% margin) without identifying a novel driver or specific mechanism for margin expansion beyond 'cost management.' Per the decision rules, the absence of any synthesis or original thesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade. The report lacks any decision-relevant specificity, offering only generic 'buy' advice based on public data.",
