    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates 'Good' analytical depth by providing clear causal mechanisms and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. It moves beyond description by linking AI integration to user engagement and forecasting margin expansion through 'benefiting from scale and AI efficiencies.' The valuation is grounded in a DCF model with quantified inputs, including a 'WACC of 8.5%, incorporating a 7% risk-free rate.' Furthermore, the report benchmarks its findings, noting the stock is 'trading at 20x forward EPS versus historical averages.' It addresses uncertainty through a 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' section and notes a '20% valuation swing possible from base case.' However, it falls short of 'Excellent' because it lacks comprehensive scenario analysis. While it provides an EPS bridge\u2014'adding $2.50 from revenue growth, $1.00 from margin expansion'\u2014it does not offer a quantified sensitivity table showing how the fair value estimate would fluctuate if key assumptions like terminal growth or WACC were adjusted. The implications are actionable, identifying the current valuation as 'attractive for long-term investors,' but the lack of stress-testing on the 48% margin peak prevents a higher grade.",
