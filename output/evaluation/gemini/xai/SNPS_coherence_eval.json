    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a high degree of internal numerical consistency, particularly between the narrative and the financial tables. The \"Fair Value and Profit Drivers\" section provides a clear EPS bridge\u2014calculating a FY2025 EPS of $11.20 from a FY2024 base\u2014which aligns perfectly with the \"Financials Snapshot\" table. Similarly, the 10% revenue CAGR and 32% terminal operating margin assumptions are consistently applied across the valuation narrative, the financials table, and the appendix. The language is professional, and the \"Analyst Note\" successfully synthesizes the recent Q2 results with the broader investment thesis. \n\nHowever, the report is fundamentally undermined by a significant temporal contradiction that triggers a mandatory hard cap. The document is dated July 8, 2025, yet it explicitly cites events and sources from August 2025. For instance, Source [8] is dated August 9, and Sources [6] and [7] are referenced as being \"3 weeks ago\" or \"4 days ago\" relative to August 10, 2025. This logical impossibility invalidates the \"recent\" claims regarding lobbying and institutional activity. Furthermore, while the \"Analyst Note\" touches upon competitive risks, the \"Bulls Say / Bears Say\" section remains a list of unreconciled points, failing to provide the integrated analysis required for a higher rating. While the financial modeling is coherent, the failure to align the report's timing with its evidence necessitates a \"fair\" grade.",
    "evidence": [
        "Report date is 2025-07-08, but Source [8] is dated 2025-08-09 and Source [7] refers to 2025-08-10.",
        "The EPS bridge in Fair Value and Profit Drivers ($9.50 + $1.20 + $0.80 - $0.30 = $11.20) perfectly matches the FY2025 Forecast in the Financials Snapshot.",
        "The 10% revenue CAGR and 32% peak margin are consistently cited in the Fair Value section, Financials Snapshot, and Appendix."
