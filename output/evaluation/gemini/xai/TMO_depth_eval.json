    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is fundamentally descriptive and fails to meet the basic requirements for analytical depth. It lacks explicit, quantified assumptions, with the 'Key Valuation Assumptions Table' and 'Financials Snapshot' entirely populated by 'insufficient data.' There are no financial forecasts for revenue, margins, or EPS, and consequently, no causal links between strategic initiatives\u2014such as the $2 billion investment\u2014and future financial performance. While it identifies 'market headwinds' and 'execution risks,' these are generic qualitative statements without quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. The report explicitly admits it 'cannot proceed without qualifying sources,' rendering it a summary of news rather than an analytical research piece. Verbatim excerpts: 'insufficient data on specific Q2 financial metrics', 'investment is aimed at enhancing capacity', 'valuation remains sensitive to sector recovery', 'No forecast data', 'No margin data', and 'Maintain hold rating'.",
