    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a basic level of analytical depth by identifying key drivers such as digital engagement and interest rate pressures. It includes an explicit EPS bridge that attempts to quantify the transition from 2024 to 2025: 'adding $0.30 from revenue growth, subtracting $0.10 from higher provisions'. However, the analysis remains largely surface-level. While it lists critical assumptions like a 3.5% revenue CAGR and an 8.5% WACC, these are not robustly benchmarked against historical performance or industry peers, other than a generic 'GDP proxy' for terminal growth. The report mentions that 'valuation swings possible by \u00b120% under stress scenarios,' but it fails to provide a quantified sensitivity analysis or a scenario table showing how specific variables (e.g., interest rate shifts or changes in deposit betas) would impact the fair value or NIM. Causal reasoning is present but generic, such as 'NII missed estimates amid ongoing pressure from the interest rate environment,' without explaining the underlying repricing mechanisms. Actionable implications are limited to a fair value estimate and a suggestion to monitor loan demand, lacking conditional 'if-then' depth for investors.",
