    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required headline sections, but the depth of analysis is inconsistent, particularly regarding financial data and sector-specific metrics. The Financials Snapshot is significantly weakened by the absence of historical data for FY 2022 and FY 2023, and it lacks critical sector-specific KPIs for a pharmaceutical/medtech firm, such as R&D intensity (R&D as % of sales) and specific pipeline/trial progression data. While the report provides a valuation bridge (EPS bridge), the underlying WACC inputs are vague and cited as 'insufficient data.' Furthermore, the report fails to provide a dedicated peer benchmarking section or any form of scenario/sensitivity analysis. The ESG and Risk sections rely on 'insufficient data' placeholders for key elements like the Sustainalytics score and talc litigation specifics, rather than providing a comprehensive assessment. These omissions of core sector KPIs and peer context, combined with the skeletal nature of the historical financials, cap the grade at 'Fair' per the evaluation instructions.",
