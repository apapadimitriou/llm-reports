    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits excellent analytical depth by providing a transparent, quantified model of value drivers. It features a detailed EPS bridge that attributes growth to specific causal factors: revenue ($1.20), margin expansion ($0.80), and R&D offsets (-$0.30). Causal mechanisms are clearly articulated, such as how \"High switching costs lock in users\" and the role of \"AI-enabled design tools\" in driving demand. Assumptions are not only explicit but also benchmarked against the \"Long-term industry average\" and peer multiples. The report effectively addresses uncertainty through multiple quantified lenses, including a \"valuation sensitivity of \u00b120% to revenue assumptions\" and a specific downside scenario where a recession could be \"reducing chip design spending by 10-15%.\" Furthermore, it provides actionable, conditional implications by identifying SNPS as \"fairly valued with upside from AI-driven demand\" while advising investors to \"monitor competitive dynamics from peers like Cadence.\" The integration of a discounted cash flow model with explicit WACC (8.5%) and terminal growth (4%) parameters provides a robust framework for the fair value estimate, meeting all criteria for the highest grade.",
