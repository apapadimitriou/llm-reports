    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a clear and explicit set of assumptions that are well-integrated into the valuation narrative. Key drivers such as the 6% revenue CAGR, 32.5% terminal operating margin, and 8.5% WACC are specifically defined with magnitudes, time horizons (2025\u20132029), and causal drivers (services-led growth and mix expansion). These inputs are justified through a combination of recent quarterly performance (Q2 2025 results) and cited external sources. The internal consistency is high; the EPS bridge from $1.65 to $7.50 reconciles with the financial snapshot table and the capital allocation strategy regarding share repurchases. However, the report fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to a lack of robust, quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers. While it mentions a potential 15-20% valuation swing related to regulatory risk, it does not provide a sensitivity matrix or scenario analysis showing how changes in the primary model inputs\u2014such as WACC, terminal growth, or services revenue growth\u2014would impact the $245 fair value estimate. Per the instruction's hard caps, the absence of quantified ranges for material drivers limits the grade to 'Fair'.",
