    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows the required structural framework but fails significantly on depth, data integrity, and sector-specific detail. It triggers multiple hard caps that necessitate a downgrade. First, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits critical sector-specific KPIs for a credit services firm, such as Payment Volume, Processed Transactions, and Cross-border Volume growth; these are only mentioned in passing in the text but are absent from the multi-year forecast table. Second, the report contains at least five instances where material claims\u2014including regulatory impact estimates, debt-to-EBITDA ratios, and historical buyback totals\u2014are explicitly marked with '[insufficient data]' or '[not specified in source],' violating the requirement for consistent evidence. Furthermore, the report exhibits excessive redundancy; the same two data points (8% payment volume and 13% cross-border growth) are repeated across four different sections (Analyst Note, Bulls/Bears, Moat, and Risk) with no additional depth or context provided in subsequent mentions. Peer benchmarking is virtually absent, and the lack of a formal scenario analysis table further diminishes the report's comprehensiveness. These cumulative deficiencies in KPI reporting, sourcing, and repetitive content result in a Poor grade.",
