{
    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions assessment due to a critical internal numeric contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While key drivers such as revenue CAGR (5%), terminal growth (3%), and WACC (9%) are explicitly stated, they lack robust justification, often relying on vague citations of historical filings to support forward-looking projections. The most significant failure is a blatant mathematical contradiction in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section: the report provides an EPS bridge starting at $12.00, adding $2.00 from revenue and subtracting $0.50 for provisions, yet concludes this yields a 2029 EPS of $18.00 (the math results in $13.50). This $4.50 discrepancy is unresolved and conflicts with the Financials Snapshot table. Furthermore, the report offers no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for material levers like net interest margins or credit loss rates, providing only a qualitative mention of potential valuation swings. Per the grading instructions, the combination of a material numeric contradiction and the lack of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
