    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying instead on restating public earnings data and utilizing boilerplate industry language. All identified insights are either restatements of Q2 2025 results or generic descriptions of Bank of America\u2019s business model (e.g., 'scale and diversification,' 'switching costs'). The valuation section uses standard DCF drivers\u2014revenue CAGR and margin expansion\u2014without introducing any novel company-specific mechanisms or non-obvious catalysts. There is no interpretive commentary linking data points, such as specific deposit beta trends or loan mix shifts, to future performance; instead, it offers generic observations about the interest rate environment and macro risks like tariffs. Consequently, the report lacks decision relevance and fails to move beyond paraphrasing cited news sources and public filings.",
