    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows the required structural framework but fails to meet the depth requirements for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to significant omissions in sector-specific data and sourcing quality. Most critically, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits essential banking KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Efficiency Ratio, and Provisions for Credit Losses, relying instead on non-standard metrics like Free Cash Flow (FCF). While a valuation bridge is attempted, the report relies on low-quality sources (e.g., social media posts) for historical financial data, violating professional standards for evidence. Furthermore, there is significant redundancy regarding macroeconomic risks (tariffs and recession) which are repeated across the Analyst Note, Strategy, Bears Say, and Risk sections without providing incremental depth or specific sensitivity analysis. The absence of a dedicated financial peer benchmarking table further limits the report's comprehensiveness.",
