    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded as Poor because it fails to provide substantive analysis across nearly all core equity research categories. While the document structure includes the necessary headers, the content is largely skeletal or entirely absent. The Financials Snapshot is a table of 'N/A' values, failing to provide even basic historical or forecasted revenue and EPS, let alone sector-specific KPIs like segment-level growth or R&D intensity. The Valuation section is non-existent, explicitly stating that data is insufficient to link operating drivers to a fair value estimate. Furthermore, the Economic Moat, Capital Allocation, and ESG sections contain no evidence-based analysis, relying instead on placeholders. There is a high degree of redundancy, as the same qualitative mentions of product innovation (TAVR, PFA) are repeated across the Analyst Note, Strategy, and Bulls/Bears sections without incremental depth. Peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analyses are completely missing. Consequently, the report lacks the quantitative rigor and analytical depth required for a professional equity research product, serving more as a template than a comprehensive evaluation.",
