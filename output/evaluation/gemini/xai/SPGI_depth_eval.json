    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates Good analytical depth by providing a structured valuation model with explicit, quantified assumptions and clear causal links. It features a causal mechanism through an EPS bridge, attributing growth to specific drivers such as \"adding $1.50 from revenue growth, $0.50 from margin expansion.\" The analyst identifies key drivers of the company's wide moat and includes quantified sensitivity analysis, noting that macro downturns could be \"reducing ratings revenue by 10-15% in a downturn\" and establishing a \"fair value sensitivity of \u00b120% under stress scenarios.\" Assumptions like the \"Terminal growth of 4% post-2029\" are benchmarked against long-term GDP and inflation. However, the report stops short of Excellent because it lacks a comprehensive multi-scenario model (e.g., distinct Bull/Bear financial statements) and does not benchmark its core revenue growth assumptions against specific industry peers or historical performance cycles. While it mentions that the \"8% revenue CAGR... driven by secular trends in ESG,\" it fails to quantify the specific contribution of these trends. The implications are actionable but lack the conditional depth required for the highest grade.",
