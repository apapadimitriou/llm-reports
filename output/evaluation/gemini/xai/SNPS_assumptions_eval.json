    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report earns a 'Fair' grade. It demonstrates high explicitness and internal consistency; key model inputs such as the 10% revenue CAGR, 32% terminal operating margin, and 8.5% WACC are clearly stated in both the narrative and the appendix, and they reconcile perfectly with the provided financial snapshot and EPS bridge. Specificity is also a strength, with clearly defined time horizons (FY2025\u2013FY2029) and magnitudes. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' primarily due to the lack of robust sensitivity analysis. While it provides a single quantified point for revenue sensitivity ('\u00b120% to revenue assumptions'), it fails to provide quantified ranges, tables, or scenarios for other material drivers such as WACC, terminal growth, or margin fluctuations. Per the grading criteria, a 'Good' rating requires quantified sensitivity for at least 2\u20133 material drivers. Additionally, the justification for the significant margin expansion from 28% to 32% is relatively thin, cited as 'efficiency gains' and 'scale' without detailed causal drivers or specific peer benchmarking to support the feasibility of such a peak.",
