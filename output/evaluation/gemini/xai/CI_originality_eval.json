    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost exclusively on restating public earnings data and generic industry boilerplate. The 'Analyst Note' is a summary of Q2 2025 results sourced directly from Yahoo Finance, and the 'Business Strategy' section uses standard phrases like 'value-based care' and 'AI-driven predictive modeling' without company-specific depth. The valuation section lacks any novel drivers, utilizing a standard DCF model with generic revenue and margin assumptions that are not linked to specific, testable catalysts. No decision-relevant insights are presented that go beyond what is available in public filings or news headlines. Consequently, the report meets the hard cap for a 'Poor' grade due to the total absence of synthesis or original perspectives.",
