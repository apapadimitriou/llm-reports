    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong internal consistency between its narrative and financial data. The Analyst Note, Fair Value section, and Financials Snapshot table all align perfectly regarding 2024 actuals ($5.0B revenue) and 2025-2029 projections (5% revenue CAGR, $6.00 to $8.50 EPS). The transition from the Q2 2025 earnings beat to the long-term valuation thesis is logical, and the economic moat section provides clear qualitative support for the quantitative assumptions.\n\nHowever, the report is severely undermined by temporal inaccuracies and internal narrative tensions, necessitating a 'fair' grade. The most glaring issue is the citation of future-dated sources; the report is dated May 21, 2025, but relies on Source [3] (July 2025) and Source [5] (August 2025). Additionally, Source [1] is dated December 2024 yet is used to support a stock price from May 2025. There is also a direct contradiction between the Analyst Note, which claims Q2 2025 results were 'above the high end of guidance,' and the Risk & Uncertainty section, which states 'insufficient data on specific Q2 2025 metrics limits precision.' While the Bulls/Bears are reconciled within the base-case valuation, these chronological impossibilities and conflicting statements regarding the availability of Q2 data represent significant lapses in coherence.",

        "Analyst Note claims Q2 results beat guidance, while Risk section cites 'insufficient data' for the same period.",
        "Narrative revenue/EPS forecasts ($5.2B and $6.00-$8.50) align perfectly with the Financials Snapshot table."
