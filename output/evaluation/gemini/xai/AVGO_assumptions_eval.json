    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for its primary valuation drivers, including revenue CAGR, AI-specific growth rates, and operating margin expansion. These inputs are clearly stated in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and summarized in a dedicated valuation table. The assumptions are justified using recent fiscal Q2 2025 results and management guidance, and they are internally consistent; the EPS bridge, revenue forecasts, and margin targets reconcile perfectly between the narrative and the financial snapshot table. However, the report fails to meet the criteria for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade due to the lack of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While it mentions that 'valuation swings of \u00b120% possible' in the Risk section, this is a qualitative statement regarding the output rather than a quantified stress test of material drivers (e.g., how the fair value estimate would change if AI growth slowed to 15% or if WACC increased). Per the instruction's hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers limits the maximum possible grade to 'Fair'.",
