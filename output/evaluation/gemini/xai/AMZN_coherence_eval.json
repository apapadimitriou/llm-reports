    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report suffers from significant internal contradictions and temporal misalignments that undermine its credibility. Most notably, the narrative in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section projects 2029 revenue at $1,050 billion, while the 'Financials Snapshot' table explicitly forecasts $981.0 billion for the same year. Furthermore, the valuation assumptions are mathematically inconsistent; the report cites a 6% risk-free rate, a 5% equity risk premium, and a 1.2 beta, which implies a cost of equity of 12%, yet it claims a WACC of 8.0% despite a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3. Even with zero-cost debt, the weighted average would exceed the stated figure.\n\nTemporal issues are also prevalent. The report is dated June 2025, yet it cites Source [8] from August 2025, effectively referencing the future. Additionally, it attributes 2025 tariff concerns to Source [6], which is dated 2018. There is also a disconnect regarding margins: the Analyst Note celebrates a current Q1 2025 operating margin of 11.8%, but the valuation model and table assume a much lower starting point of 8.5% for the 2025 forecast without explaining the sharp projected decline. These errors require the reader to reconstruct the argument, as the provided data points frequently clash. While the structure is standard, the lack of internal consistency between the narrative, the tables, and the cited sources results in a poor coherence rating.",
