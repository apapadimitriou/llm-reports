    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to multiple significant internal numeric contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers. First, the WACC is stated as 7.0%, but the provided components (4% risk-free rate, 0.8 beta, and 5% equity risk premium) calculate to 8.0%, creating an unresolved discrepancy in the discount rate. Second, the EPS bridge is mathematically incoherent: the narrative claims that starting from a 2025 EPS of $13.75 and applying specific adjustments (+$2.50, +$1.00, -$0.75) yields a 2029 EPS of $28.00, whereas the actual sum is $16.50. These errors demonstrate a failure in internal consistency and auditability across the narrative and tables. Furthermore, the report lacks robust stress-testing. While it mentions a potential 30% variance in fair value, this is a qualitative statement regarding the final output rather than a quantified sensitivity analysis of material drivers (e.g., a matrix showing the impact of varying revenue growth or margins). Although assumptions are explicitly stated, the presence of two distinct numeric contradictions and the absence of driver-level sensitivities trigger a 'Poor' grade under the mandatory decision rules.",
