    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive statistics to explain the causal drivers behind financial trends. It identifies the \"shift toward higher-margin subscription services\" as the primary mechanism for margin expansion and links slowing billings to \"customers prioritize platform consolidation.\" Assumptions are explicit and benchmarked against industry growth rates (12% market CAGR) and peer ESG scores. The inclusion of a multi-year EPS bridge (\"EPS bridge: FY2025 base EPS $5.50... yielding FY2029 EPS $11.00\") provides a clear roadmap of value creation, distinguishing between revenue growth and margin gains. However, the report falls short of an 'Excellent' grade because it lacks a formal sensitivity analysis or quantified scenario modeling. While it notes that uncertainty \"could swing valuation by 20-30%,\" it does not provide specific price targets for alternative scenarios or test how changes in key inputs (like WACC or terminal growth) would impact the $195 fair value estimate. The \"WACC is 9.5%, reflecting high beta (1.2)\" is a solid explicit assumption, but the terminal growth rate of 4% is aggressive and lacks a specific benchmark to justify it against long-term GDP. Overall, the reasoning is clear and tied to valuation, but the treatment of uncertainty remains qualitative rather than model-driven.",
