    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions criteria primarily due to multiple material internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key drivers such as revenue CAGR (7%), WACC (7.5%), and terminal growth (3%), these inputs are not reconciled with the provided financial tables. Specifically, the narrative claims EPS will scale to $40.00 by 2029, yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table explicitly forecasts 2029 EPS at $37.00. Furthermore, the report targets a 13\u201316% EPS growth rate, but the data in the forecast table (growing from $27.8 in 2025 to $37.0 in 2029) implies a CAGR of only approximately 7.4%, creating a massive disconnect between the strategic outlook and the model outputs. Additionally, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers like WACC or medical loss ratios; the report merely mentions qualitative risks and a generic fair value range in the glossary. Per the grading instructions, the presence of two or more distinct numeric contradictions between the text and tables, combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities, necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
