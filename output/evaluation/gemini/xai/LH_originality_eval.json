    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost entirely on restating a single news source regarding Q2 2025 earnings (revenue beat/EPS miss) and filling the remainder of the document with 'Insufficient data' or generic industry boilerplate. There are no quantified drivers, no peer-specific comparisons, and no actionable insights beyond a basic 'hold' recommendation based on public headlines. The valuation section is completely empty, lacking even basic assumptions or a DCF framework, which triggers a hard cap. The strategy and outlook sections use generic phrases like 'leveraging scale' and 'aging populations' that are applicable to any diagnostics firm, offering zero company-specific interpretive value. Because there is a total absence of synthesis or original thesis, the report meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",
