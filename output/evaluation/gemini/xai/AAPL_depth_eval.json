    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates 'Good' analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to provide a structured valuation framework. Causal reasoning is evident in the explanation of how the 'iOS ecosystem creates high switching costs' and how the 'services mix expansion' drives the forecasted expansion of operating margins to 32.5%. The author provides explicit, quantified assumptions for a DCF model, including a 'WACC is set at 8.5%' and a 'Terminal growth rate of 3%.' Inference quality is supported by a detailed EPS bridge that attributes growth to specific drivers like revenue uplift and share repurchases. While the report includes a quantified sensitivity\u2014noting that 'regulatory outcomes could swing valuation by 15-20%'\u2014it stops short of 'Excellent' because it lacks a comprehensive sensitivity matrix or discrete Bull/Bear valuation scenarios. Benchmarking is present but limited, such as comparing ESG risk to 'Samsung (20/100)' and P/E to 'historical premiums.' The implications are actionable, providing a clear 'Fair-Value Estimate $245.00' with conditional warnings regarding China exposure and regulatory scrutiny.",
