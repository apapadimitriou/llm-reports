    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report primarily functions as a summary of public news and earnings transcripts rather than a source of original investment insight. It correctly identifies a major catalyst\u2014the lifting of the 2018 regulatory asset cap\u2014and attempts a weak synthesis by linking this event to a specific 4% revenue CAGR and a 2029 EPS target of $7.50. However, this synthesis lacks depth; it does not provide a detailed mechanism for how the balance sheet will be redeployed or how risk-weighted assets will be optimized relative to peers. Most other insights, such as the 'wide moat' based on switching costs and the 'Bulls/Bears' arguments, are generic to the diversified banking sector or directly paraphrased from the cited sources (e.g., CNBC, Seeking Alpha). The valuation section follows a standard DCF format with boilerplate drivers, failing to introduce novel company-specific variables like deposit beta trajectories or specific non-interest expense reductions. Because the report relies on more than three restated or generic insights and lacks a strong, quantified original thesis, it is capped at the 'Fair' grade.",
