    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a fair grade due to material contradictions between the narrative assumptions and the supporting financial tables. The Fair Value and Profit Drivers section explicitly states that the analyst models across-a-cycle operating margins of around 26%, yet the Morningstar Valuation Model Summary table on page 16 displays calculated operating margins (Operating Income divided by Total Pre-Provision Revenue) that consistently exceed 28.5% throughout the 2025-2027 forecast period. This discrepancy suggests a lack of alignment between the text and the underlying model. Furthermore, the Forecast Revisions table on page 17 is internally inconsistent with the Analyst Notes Archive. The table compares the current $101 Fair Value Estimate (FVE) to an $89.19 figure from September 2023, bypassing the $106 and $97 FVEs mentioned in the archive notes from November 2024 and January 2025. While the qualitative analysis of the company's narrow moat and the strategic shift toward wealth management is coherent and well-detailed, these quantitative mismatches force the reader to reconcile the argument themselves. The Bears Say section regarding capital rules is noted but not fully integrated into the Exemplary capital allocation narrative, which focuses more on historical success than the specific 20% RWA headwind mentioned in the strategy section. These unresolved tensions between data and prose prevent a higher grade.",
    "evidence": [
        "Narrative models operating margins at 'around 26%' (Fair Value and Profit Drivers, p. 8), but the Valuation Model Summary (p. 16) shows forecast margins of 28.5%-29.5% for 2025-2027.",
        "Forecast Revisions table (p. 17) cites a prior FVE of $89.19 from 2023, contradicting the Analyst Notes Archive (p. 10-11) which documents FVEs of $106 and $97 in late 2024 and early 2025.",
        "Strategy section (p. 2) notes Basel III could increase risk-weighted assets by 20%, but the Capital Allocation section (p. 9) maintains an 'Exemplary' rating without detailing how this specific headwind is reconciled with future return strategies."
