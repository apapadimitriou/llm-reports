    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s assumptions are explicit and well-integrated into the valuation narrative. Key drivers, particularly the transition from Humira to the next-generation immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are clearly stated with specific magnitudes. The analyst provides a detailed revenue bridge, citing a $31 billion combined sales target for Skyrizi and Rinvoq by 2027, justified by a 20% CAGR and management guidance. Specificity is high, with units (USD), time horizons (2027, 2029), and causal drivers (biosimilar competition and pricing erosion) explicitly defined. Internal consistency is strong; the WACC (7.0%), cost of equity (7.5%), and long-run tax rate (21%) stated in the text reconcile with the detailed valuation tables. While the report lacks a standard sensitivity matrix for valuation inputs like WACC, it provides a robust, quantified scenario analysis for a material macro risk: pharmaceutical tariffs. The analyst calculates a specific 2-percentage-point operating margin headwind and a 6% hit to operating profits in a worst-case scenario, demonstrating a commitment to stress-testing material drivers. Justification is evidence-rich, utilizing multi-year historical growth rates for newer drugs and peer-benchmarked legal cost assumptions (1.5% of net income). The forecast for stable operating margins is internally coherent when viewed as a recovery from the 2024 transition trough, with the 2025-2029 period showing a tight range of 34.7% to 37.6%.",
