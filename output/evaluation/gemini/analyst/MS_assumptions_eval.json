    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are explicit and specific regarding revenue (2.5% CAGR), NII (8% CAGR), and cost of equity (9%), but it fails significantly on consistency and sensitivity. Most critically, the report contains multiple distinct contradictions between its narrative and the valuation model. While the analyst rates capital allocation as 'Exemplary' and highlights a history of share repurchases and dividend growth supported by 'billions in excess capital,' the model assumes a perfectly static share count (1,611 million) and flat dividends ($3.70) through 2029. This 'flat share count' contradiction is explicitly cited in the grading rubric as a hallmark of 'Poor' quality. Additionally, the narrative notes the company has 'increased its dividend payout over time,' yet the model forecasts zero growth for five years. Furthermore, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for Morgan Stanley's specific material drivers (e.g., NIM, AUM growth, or credit costs) and their impact on the $101 fair value estimate, relying instead on qualitative 'Bulls/Bears' commentary and a general sector-level note regarding tariffs. Per the decision rules, the combination of at least one distinct contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
