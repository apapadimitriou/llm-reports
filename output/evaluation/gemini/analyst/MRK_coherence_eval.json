    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates exceptional structural coherence by seamlessly integrating the April 2025 Analyst Note with the foundational analysis from late 2024 and early 2025. The narrative arc is clear: it acknowledges immediate headwinds, such as the 41% Gardasil decline in China and pharmaceutical tariffs, while reinforcing the long-term 'Wide Moat' thesis centered on Keytruda and a strengthening pipeline. A standout feature is the precise alignment between the narrative and the financial tables; for instance, the Analyst Note cites a $200 million tariff headwind for 2025, which is directly reflected in the 'Forecast Revisions' table where 2025 revenue was adjusted downward by approximately $206 million. Furthermore, the report proactively resolves the tension between the 'Bear Say' regarding the 2028 Keytruda patent cliff and the base-case valuation. It does this by detailing specific mitigation strategies, such as the subcutaneous formulation expected for September approval and 'underappreciated' pipeline programs like the oral cholesterol-lowering drug. Terminology is used consistently, with clear distinctions between GAAP and non-GAAP figures, particularly in the Capital Allocation and Analyst Note sections. Temporal claims are highly accurate, with 'recent' events like the April 2025 tariff announcements and the February 2025 HHS confirmation correctly situated relative to the report's publication date. The transitions between the high-level strategy and the granular quarterly updates ensure the reader understands how new data points impact the overall fair value estimate without needing to assemble the argument themselves.",
    "evidence": [
        "An estimated $200 million tariff headwind for 2025 in the Analyst Note (Page 1) aligns with the $206 million downward revision to 2025 revenue in the Forecast Revisions table (Page 14).",
        "The report reconciles the 2028 Keytruda patent loss (Bears Say, Page 3) by highlighting the 'potential approval of a subcutaneous version... in September' to protect sales (Analyst Note, Page 1).",
        "The 41% Gardasil decline in Q1 (Analyst Note, Page 1) is consistent with the 'significant' decline and lowered 2030 sales assumptions detailed in the Fair Value section (Page 4)."
