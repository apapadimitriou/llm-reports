    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit key assumptions, including a five-year revenue CAGR of 18% and a long-term non-GAAP operating margin target in the 'mid-30% area.' These are supported by qualitative drivers such as generative AI adoption (Pro Plus SKUs) and high customer retention rates (98-99%). Specificity is high regarding time horizons (5-year Stage I, 20-year perpetuity) and valuation inputs (8.8% WACC, 20% tax rate). However, the quality of assumptions is limited by two primary factors. First, there is a significant lack of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for material drivers like revenue growth or margin expansion; while the methodology mentions scenario analysis, no specific ranges or valuation impacts are provided in the text or tables. This triggers a hard cap of 'Fair' per the instruction. Second, there is an unresolved internal inconsistency between the narrative and the financial tables regarding profitability. The analyst cites a 30.9% non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 2025 and a 30% actual for 2024, yet the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table only provides GAAP figures (e.g., 12.4% operating margin for 2024), with no reconciliation provided to bridge the two. This makes the primary margin assumption opaque and difficult to audit against the provided financial statements. Consequently, while the assumptions are explicit and generally justified by business trends, the lack of stress-testing and the GAAP/non-GAAP disconnect prevent a higher grade.",
