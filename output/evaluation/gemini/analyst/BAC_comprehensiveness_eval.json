    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, covering all expected content areas for a diversified bank. It includes a detailed Analyst Note, Business Strategy, Economic Moat analysis, and a robust Financials Snapshot. Proportional depth is well-maintained, particularly in the Economic Moat section which provides a granular breakdown of segment-level competitive advantages across Consumer, Wealth, and Global Banking divisions. Evidence integration is strong, utilizing sector-specific KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Net Interest Income (NII), Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE), and Efficiency Ratios, all of which are present in both the narrative and the multi-year financial tables. The valuation section provides an explicit link between operating drivers\u2014specifically the repricing of the long-duration securities portfolio\u2014and the fair value outcome. Peer benchmarking is clearly presented in a dedicated table comparing valuation multiples and moat ratings across major money-center banks. While the report includes qualitative 'Bulls/Bears' scenarios and a specific bear-case impact for macro events (tariffs) in the analyst archive, it lacks a formal quantitative sensitivity analysis or a valuation matrix (e.g., Fair Value sensitivity to Cost of Equity or NIM shifts). There is some thematic overlap regarding duration risk, but it is applied contextually across different sections rather than being purely redundant. The inclusion of material ESG risk assessments and a thorough appendix further supports the 'Good' grade.",
