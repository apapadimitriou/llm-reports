    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high explicitness and specificity regarding its core valuation drivers. The analyst provides clear magnitudes and time horizons for Merck\u2019s most critical products, specifically forecasting Keytruda to peak at over $40 billion by 2028 before declining below $10 billion by 2032 due to patent expirations. Gardasil assumptions are similarly detailed, with a revised 2030 global sales target of $7 billion justified by specific headwinds in the Chinese market. These inputs are proximal to the forecasts and reconcile perfectly with the provided financial tables, which show a corresponding revenue dip in 2029. Justification is solid, leveraging clinical data, regulatory timelines (e.g., 2028 US patent loss), and historical performance. Internal consistency is clean, with no numeric contradictions found between the narrative and the valuation model summary. However, the report fails to provide quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for these material drivers. While the \"Risk and Uncertainty\" section discusses potential impacts from US drug policy and China\u2019s economic recovery qualitatively, it lacks the quantified ranges or \"what-if\" valuation impacts required for a higher grade. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities for material levers like Keytruda\u2019s sales trajectory or Gardasil\u2019s recovery necessitates a hard cap at \"Fair.\"",
