    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple internal numeric contradictions and a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. Regarding explicitness, the report identifies key drivers such as Azure growth, AI adoption, and margin expansion. However, a significant contradiction exists between the narrative and the data tables: the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section states that operating margins were 45% in fiscal 2024 (actual), whereas the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table on page 16 records the 2024 actual operating margin as 41.8%. Furthermore, while the text explicitly predicts 'interim pressure' on margins for fiscal 2025 due to accounting changes and Activision integration, the model table forecasts a margin expansion from 41.8% to 44.6% in that same period. Justification is only partial; the analyst cites historical context to explain growth, but specific causal magnitudes for AI's contribution remain vague. Most critically, the report fails the sensitivity requirement. While it assigns a 'Medium' uncertainty rating and describes a general methodology for margin-of-safety brackets, it provides no quantified scenarios or sensitivity tables (e.g., varying WACC or Azure growth rates) to demonstrate the impact on the $505 fair value estimate. Instead, it refers users to an external website for scenarios. This lack of internal stress-testing, combined with the 320-basis-point discrepancy in historical margin data, renders the assumptions internally inconsistent and the valuation process opaque.",
