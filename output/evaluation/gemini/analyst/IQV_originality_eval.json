    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides at least three distinct syntheses that link specific operational mechanisms to quantified financial outcomes, moving beyond simple restatement of earnings. First, it synthesizes the impact of AI investments (via the NVIDIA collaboration) by quantifying a 30% cost reduction and a two-thirds reduction in delivery time for commercial systems, linking this directly to long-term margin expansion. Second, it identifies a specific shift toward fixed-price contracting in the R&DS segment as a driver for cost visibility and margin retention. Third, it highlights the transition of the CRM business from an implementation phase to a high-margin recurring revenue phase. While the report relies on some boilerplate descriptions of the 2016 merger and generic industry outsourcing trends, these company-specific drivers for the 10-year forecast provide decision-relevant value. It misses an 'Excellent' grade due to a lack of deep peer-comparative analysis and specific monitoring signals or timelines for the identified catalysts.",
