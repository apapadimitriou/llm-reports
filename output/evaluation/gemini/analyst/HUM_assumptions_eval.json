    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are graded Poor due to multiple significant internal contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly states key drivers such as revenue growth, EPS targets, and WACC, the data is internally inconsistent. Specifically, there is a glaring contradiction within the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table: the Operating Income (USD Mil) is projected to increase from $2,562 in 2024 to $3,312 in 2025, yet the 'Operating Income Growth %' row for 2025 reports a 36.2% decline. Similar misalignments exist for revenue growth figures, where the growth percentages appear shifted or incorrectly calculated relative to the absolute dollar values. \n\nFurthermore, the narrative describes profit prospects as 'roughly stagnant through 2026,' which directly conflicts with the model's forecast of a ~36% drop in adjusted net income for that year ($1,960M in 2024 to $1,287M in 2026). While justification is provided through discussions of Medicare Advantage utilization and star ratings, the lack of internal consistency makes the model unauditable. Finally, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario ranges for material levers like medical loss ratios or MA margins, offering only a qualitative mention of 'low-single-digit' risks for the PBM segment. Per the instruction's hard caps, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
