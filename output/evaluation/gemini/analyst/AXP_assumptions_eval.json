    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are explicit and well-justified by historical data and peer benchmarks, but it fails the evaluation due to multiple internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. The analyst provides specific magnitudes for key drivers, such as a 6.1% NII CAGR and a 12.2% card fee CAGR, supported by multi-year trends and competitive positioning. However, the report triggers a 'Poor' grade under the hard cap rules for two distinct contradictions combined with the absence of sensitivities. First, the narrative cites company guidance for 2025 EPS of $15.00\u2013$15.50 as 'readily achievable,' yet the valuation table forecasts $15.97 for the same period without explaining the discrepancy. Second, the report describes a 'Standard' capital allocation policy characterized by a 'clear willingness' to use share buybacks to return excess capital, yet the model assumes a perfectly flat share count of 703 million from 2025 through 2029. Furthermore, while the report qualitatively discusses risks like macroeconomic pressure and travel spending, it provides no quantified bull/bear scenarios or sensitivity tables for material levers like net interest margins or credit loss rates. These unresolved numeric and logical conflicts between the narrative and the financial tables, coupled with the lack of stress-testing, result in a 'Poor' assessment.",
