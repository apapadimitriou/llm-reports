    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a clear narrative structure and generally smooth transitions between the analyst's updates and the core valuation sections. The analyst effectively links current market volatility to CME's countercyclical performance, providing a logical flow from macro conditions to company-specific results. However, significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the provided financial tables necessitate a 'fair' grade under the rubric's hard caps. Specifically, the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section predicts an operating margin increase to 63.2% by 2028, yet the 'Margins & Returns' table already reports a 64.1% margin for 2024 and forecasts 64.5% for 2028. More critically, the 'Operating Performance' table lists a catastrophic ROIC of -78.2% for 2025 and similar negative values through 2029. This directly contradicts the 'Wide Moat' designation and the narrative claim that the firm will 'earn excess returns on capital for the foreseeable future.' Additionally, while the report is dated April 2025, the 'Economic Moat' section has not been updated since August 2024, though it remains largely relevant. The Bulls and Bears are well-reconciled with the base-case valuation, which accounts for the expected normalization of interest-rate volatility. Despite the strong prose, the data integrity issues in the tables undermine the report's overall coherence.",

        "Narrative anticipates operating margin to increase to 63.2% by 2028 (Page 6) while the table shows 64.1% in 2024 and 64.5% in 2028 (Page 14).",
        "ROIC % for 2025-2029 is listed between -78.2% and -72.3% in the table (Page 14), contradicting the Wide Moat status and 'excess returns' narrative (Page 4).",
        "The report claims the firm will 'earn excess returns on capital for the foreseeable future' (Economic Moat, Page 4) which is mathematically impossible with the negative ROIC figures provided in the model summary."
