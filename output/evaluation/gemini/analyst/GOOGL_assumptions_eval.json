    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "Alphabet's report demonstrates high-quality assumptions across all five pillars. Explicitness is strong, with key drivers like segment-specific revenue growth (Search, YouTube, Cloud) and operating margins clearly defined in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section. Justification is evidence-rich, citing historical R&D spending (14-16%), past share buyback performance (9% reduction), and specific causal drivers such as AI monetization and cloud capacity constraints. Specificity is excellent, providing precise magnitudes (e.g., 26% Cloud CAGR, $75B capex) and a clear five-year time horizon. Consistency is maintained between the narrative and the detailed 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table, with figures like the 32% operating margin and 9% WACC reconciling perfectly. Finally, the report provides robust quantified sensitivities through detailed Bull and Bear scenarios. These scenarios specifically model the impact of antitrust actions on Search revenue and Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), resulting in clear valuation impacts ($175 Bear vs. $266 Bull). The inclusion of a specific 10% FVE reduction scenario for tariff impacts further enhances the stress-testing, moving the analysis beyond a single-point estimate. The assumptions are traceable and auditable, meeting the highest standards for equity research quality.",
