    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high originality through multiple decision-relevant syntheses and original theses. It goes beyond standard financial reporting by linking specific product adoption curves (Farapulse and Watchman) to a quantified Fair Value Estimate (FVE) increase from $84 to $93. The analyst provides a sophisticated competitive analysis of the Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) market, specifically identifying Johnson & Johnson's Varipulse launch pause as a tactical window for Boston Scientific to solidify its #2 global position. Furthermore, the report quantifies macro headwinds, detailing a $200 million tariff impact and the specific 50/50 mitigation strategy (FX vs. cost-cutting) employed by management. The analysis of the Watchman franchise is particularly strong, identifying specific clinical trial catalysts (Option trial in 2025 and Champion trial in 2026) that could transition the device to a first-line treatment, thereby expanding the addressable market. These insights are company-specific, quantified, and provide clear monitoring signals for investors, meeting the criteria for an Excellent grade.",
