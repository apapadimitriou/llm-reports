    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high comprehensiveness by covering all essential content areas for a major financial institution. It includes a detailed Analyst Note on recent earnings, a clear business strategy, and a deep dive into the economic moat. Proportionality is well-maintained, with significant depth provided for the asset management and investment banking segments. Evidence integration is excellent, utilizing specific 2025 Q1 figures such as the $4.6 billion net income and $3.17 trillion in assets under supervision. Sector-appropriate KPIs are consistently applied, including Net Interest Margin (NIM), Efficiency Ratio, and CET1 capital ratios, which are critical for evaluating a global bank. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers\u2014such as projected revenue growth rates for trading and investment banking\u2014to the final fair value outcome. Peer benchmarking is a strength, with a comprehensive table comparing Goldman to Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley. The report is only held back from an \"Excellent\" grade by the absence of a quantitative scenario or sensitivity analysis table that would illustrate how the fair value estimate changes under different fundamental assumptions. There is minimal redundancy, and the appendix provides necessary methodological context.",
