    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor primarily due to multiple material numeric contradictions between the narrative and the financial summary tables, which undermines the auditability of the model. While the report is explicit in stating its key drivers\u2014such as a 10% Adjusted EPS CAGR and 3% revenue growth\u2014these figures do not reconcile with the 'Growth & Ratios' table on page 15. Specifically, the table labels the 5-year Adjusted EPS CAGR as 16.2% and the GAAP EPS CAGR as 9.1%, whereas the raw data in the same table calculates to approximately 9.7% and 16.2% respectively, suggesting a labeling swap or calculation error. Furthermore, the narrative's 3% revenue growth assumption conflicts with the table's 2.6% CAGR. \n\nJustification for assumptions is partial; the analyst cites PBM contract losses and Medicare Advantage margin recovery as causal drivers but provides limited historical or peer benchmarking to support the specific magnitudes of the recovery. Specificity is solid regarding units and time horizons. However, sensitivity analysis is insufficient for a 'High' uncertainty rating. While the report offers some quantified impacts for specific segments (e.g., $3-$4 EPS upside for Medicare Advantage margins and low-single-digit PBM headwinds), it lacks a systematic, quantified sensitivity matrix or scenario analysis showing the impact of material levers on the final Fair Value Estimate. Per the instruction's hard caps, two or more distinct contradictions necessitate a 'Poor' grade.",
