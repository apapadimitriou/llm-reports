    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report earns a 'Fair' grade for its quality of assumptions, primarily due to the absence of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for its material drivers, which triggers a mandatory hard cap. While the report explicitly states its key inputs\u2014projecting an 8% CAGR for retail, 16% for AWS, and 17% for advertising\u2014it does not provide a range of outcomes or 'what-if' scenarios for these specific levers within the document, instead referring users to an external link.\n\nIn terms of explicitness and specificity, the report is strong. It provides clear magnitudes, units, and time horizons (e.g., GAAP operating margin expanding to 13% by 2029). These assumptions are proximal to the valuation narrative and reconcile perfectly with the detailed 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table. Justification is solid but largely qualitative, relying on the 'Wide Moat' narrative and secular trends rather than rigorous multi-year historical benchmarking or peer comparisons for the specific growth rates chosen.\n\nInternal consistency is excellent; there are no unresolved numeric contradictions between the text and the financial tables. The valuation components, including a WACC of 8.7% and a Stage II EBI growth rate of 8.0%, are clearly disclosed in the 'Key Valuation Drivers' section. However, the reliance on a generic 'Uncertainty Rating' to address risk, without providing quantified sensitivities for the most sensitive drivers like AWS growth or margin expansion, limits the auditability of the model's robustness.",
