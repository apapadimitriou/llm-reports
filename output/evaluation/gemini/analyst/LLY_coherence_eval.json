    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates high structural coherence, effectively integrating a real-time Analyst Note (1 May 2025) with deeper strategic analysis from April and February. The narrative flow is logical, moving from immediate Q1 earnings results to long-term valuation drivers. A significant strength is the explicit reconciliation between the company's strong performance and the analyst's 'Overvalued' rating; the report explains that while Lilly is meeting growth targets, the market is underestimating pricing pressures and competition from Novo Nordisk. This tension is addressed directly in the 'Bottom Line' of the 1 May note and the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section. Terminology is used consistently, particularly regarding GLP-1 market dynamics and margin expansion. The report avoids 'bullet dumps,' using narrative paragraphs to explain the 'why' behind the data. Temporal alignment is generally strong, with the Analyst Note Archive providing a clear audit trail of fair value changes (e.g., the 7 April increase to $650). There is a minor numerical friction where the 7 April 'Business Strategy' section cites a 34% growth rate for 2025, while the 1 May Valuation Model table shows 32.0%. However, this is mitigated by the 'Forecast Revisions' table on page 14, which explicitly documents the downward revision in revenue and EPS on 1 May. This transparency reinforces the report's reliability rather than detracting from its coherence.",
    "evidence": [
        "\"We're cautious on pricing... We think the market was assuming more stable pricing and greater Lilly dominance.\" (Analyst Note, Page 1)",
        "\"We now assume that orforglipron sales could approach $20 billion by 2034, up from roughly $10 billion in our prior valuation.\" (Analyst Note Archive, Page 8)",
        "The \"Forecast Revisions\" table (Page 14) provides a bridge between the 7 April narrative and the 1 May financial data, explaining the shift in 2025 revenue growth expectations."
