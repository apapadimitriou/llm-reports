    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits significant analytical depth by linking macroeconomic conditions to specific business segment performance. It provides clear causal reasoning, such as explaining that \"trading volumes spiked amid continued developments in tariff policies\" and noting how \"macroeconomic uncertainty typically exhibits downward pressure on merger activity.\" The quality of inference is high, with segment forecasts tied to structural drivers like the \"shift to wealth management fee-based assets from commission-based.\" Data usage is robust, featuring explicit, quantified assumptions such as a \"cost of equity of 9% in our discounted cash flow\" and \"across-a-cycle operating margins of around 26%.\" The analyst benchmarks performance by comparing current trading revenue levels to pre-2020 averages and evaluating capital ratios against peer groups. While the report includes a \"Bulls Say / Bears Say\" section and an analyst note quantifying a \"midteens percentage fair value estimate decrease\" for a specific tariff-related bear case, it lacks a comprehensive sensitivity matrix or multi-scenario valuation table for the primary $101 fair value estimate. The reasoning suggests that \"trading revenue should ultimately correct from its currently elevated level,\" but the specific impact of varying interest rates or market returns on the final valuation is not stress-tested in a structured format. Consequently, while the implications are actionable\u2014viewing shares as \"modestly overvalued\"\u2014the report falls just short of the \"Excellent\" grade due to the lack of integrated, quantified sensitivity ranges for its core valuation model.",
