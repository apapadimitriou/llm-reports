    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a high degree of explicitness regarding its valuation inputs, primarily through the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' and 'Key Valuation Drivers' tables. Key assumptions, including a 7.0% WACC, a 16.0% long-run tax rate, and 5.0%-6.0% organic revenue growth, are clearly stated and proximal to the fair value estimate. Justification is solid, with the analyst anchoring organic growth expectations against a decade of historical performance (4%-5%) and industry benchmarks (3%). Specificity is a strength, as the report details magnitudes for inorganic growth (100 bps) and identifies causal drivers for margin expansion, such as manufacturing shifts to lower-cost regions and internal sourcing efforts. Internal consistency is generally maintained; the narrative's expectation for 'steadily improving' margins reconciles with the model's forecast of operating margins rising from 17.1% in 2024 to 22.7% by 2029. However, the report fails to meet the criteria for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade due to the total absence of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers within the document. While the methodology mentions scenario analysis and the 'Risk and Uncertainty' section qualitatively discusses tariffs and China demand, there are no tables or ranges illustrating how changes in revenue growth, margins, or discount rates would impact the $630 fair value estimate. Per the grading instructions, the lack of quantified sensitivities on material drivers necessitates a 'Fair' grade.",
