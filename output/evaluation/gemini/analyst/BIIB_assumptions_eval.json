    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid explicitness and specificity regarding its core valuation assumptions. Key revenue drivers, such as peak sales for Leqembi ($3 billion), Skyclarys ($1 billion), and Ocrevus royalties ($9 billion), are clearly stated within the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section. These assumptions are well-justified through detailed discussions of the competitive landscape, including specific threats from Novartis and Roche, and regulatory headwinds like the Inflation Reduction Act and Medicare Part D redesign. Internal consistency is high; the narrative's description of the MS franchise's decline and the slow Leqembi launch is accurately reflected in the multi-year financial forecast table and the significant downward revision of the Fair Value Estimate from $303 to $220. The report also provides specific parameters for the DCF model, including a 7.1% WACC and an 18% long-run tax rate. However, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for its most material drivers. While the analyst qualitatively acknowledges 'considerable uncertainty' and a 'wide range of outcomes' for Leqembi's sales ramp, there are no tables or figures illustrating how different sales trajectories or changes in the discount rate would impact the final valuation. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities on material drivers necessitates a hard cap, resulting in a 'Fair' grade despite the otherwise high quality and transparency of the stated inputs.",
