    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits excellent analytical depth by providing a comprehensive causal framework for AbbVie\u2019s post-Humira growth strategy. It moves beyond simple data reporting to explain the 'why' behind margin stability, noting that 'new immunology drugs carry strong enough margins to offset' the lost sales of Humira. The analyst provides explicit, benchmarked assumptions, such as 'model base case annual legal costs at 1.5%' based on a 50% probability of future litigation, and noting that R&D spending is 'below the industry average.' The report is particularly strong in its treatment of uncertainty and scenario analysis. It quantifies the potential impact of macro risks, stating a '25% tariff would amount to a 2-percentage-point margin headwind.' It also evaluates the 'pill penalty' regarding Medicare negotiation timelines and the potential for international price benchmarking. These scenarios are tied directly to the decision to maintain the fair value estimate. Verbatim excerpts include: 'Skyrizi (71% growth) and Rinvoq (57%) were the strongest drivers,' '25% tariff would amount to a 2-percentage-point margin headwind,' 'model base case annual legal costs at 1.5%,' and 'new immunology drugs carry strong enough margins to offset.' The implications are clear and conditional, advising investors to watch the 'early-stage pipeline for potential to raise our valuation.'",
