    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high originality through multiple decision-relevant syntheses that go beyond standard financial reporting. A primary original thesis involves the strategic rationale for the diabetes business spinoff; the analyst identifies an internal 'capital allocation conflict' where the diabetes unit struggled to secure resources against high-priority projects like TAVR and renal denervation. This provides a company-specific angle on corporate strategy. Furthermore, the report synthesizes product-level data into quantified financial trajectories, specifically linking the adoption of Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) and PulseSelect technology to a 4% top-line growth target and a competitive disruption of incumbents J&J and Abbott. The analyst also provides a nuanced synthesis of macro risks, differentiating the impact of new tariffs on diabetes device makers versus diversified peers based on manufacturing flexibility. The valuation section is supported by these specific product drivers rather than generic assumptions, and the margin expansion thesis (peaking at 21% by 2029) is explicitly tied to the mix-shift resulting from the spinoff. These insights are highly actionable, providing clear catalysts and competitive benchmarks.",
