    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is rated 'fair' primarily due to significant unresolved contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables. In the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section, the analyst explicitly projects a 7% improvement in Net Interest Income (NII) for 2025. However, the 'Growth & Ratios' table on page 14 lists 2025 NII growth at -3.0%. While the raw dollar values in the table ($14,441M for 2025 vs $13,499M for 2024) mathematically support the 7% increase, the growth percentage row is internally inconsistent. Furthermore, the narrative assumes a 'normalized return on tangible common equity of roughly 16.5%' and an efficiency ratio declining to 'about 58%.' Neither of these targets is achieved within the explicit five-year forecast period, where ROTE peaks at 13.9% and the efficiency ratio remains above 60%, actually trending upward in the later years of the model. Structurally, the report is well-organized, and the Analyst Note (15 Apr 2025) successfully integrates the latest Q1 results with the broader strategy. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' sections are reconciled with the base-case valuation, particularly regarding tariff-related economic uncertainty. However, the 'Economic Moat' section uses the term 'recently' to describe Federal Reserve liquidity requirement changes that occurred years prior to the 2025 report date. These data-narrative misalignments force the reader to reconcile the argument themselves, preventing a higher grade.",
