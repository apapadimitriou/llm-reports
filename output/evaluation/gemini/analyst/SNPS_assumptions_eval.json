    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and proximal assumptions for all material drivers, including segment-specific revenue CAGRs (10% for EDA, 11-12% for IP), long-term operating margin targets (31% by 2034), and a specific 7.5% cost of equity. Justification is solid, linking forecasts to secular trends such as AI-driven design starts, multi-die architectures, and the strategic Ansys acquisition. Specificity is high, with clearly defined time horizons (5 and 10-year CAGRs) and units. Internal consistency is maintained across the narrative and the valuation model summary; for instance, the decline in China revenue is reflected in both the analyst notes and the 2025 revenue growth forecast (4.9% vs. historical 15%+). Sensitivity analysis is present and quantified for the most material immediate driver\u2014the potential China sales ban\u2014providing a clear impact on the Fair Value Estimate ($550 to $510). However, the report lacks a broader, multi-variable sensitivity matrix for other key levers like WACC or terminal growth, which prevents an 'Excellent' rating. Overall, the assumptions are traceable, auditable, and well-supported by industry context and historical performance.",
