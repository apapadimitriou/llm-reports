    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, covering all mandatory sections from the executive summary to a detailed financial appendix. It provides strong sector-specific context for a fintech firm, including organic growth rates by segment (Banking, Capital Markets) and retention metrics (99%). The valuation section is well-integrated, explicitly linking the strategic shift toward stable bank technology and cost-reduction plans to the 4% revenue CAGR and margin expansion assumptions in the DCF model. Peer benchmarking is robust, featuring a comparative table of valuation multiples and moat ratings for key competitors like Fiserv and Global Payments. However, the report stops short of 'Excellent' because it lacks explicit scenario or sensitivity analysis tables (e.g., a matrix showing the impact of varying WACC or terminal growth rates on the Fair Value Estimate) within the document text, although it mentions these are available via external links. Evidence is consistently integrated, though largely reliant on internal Morningstar models and management guidance. The financial snapshot is exhaustive, providing multi-year historical data and five-year forecasts across income, balance sheet, and cash flow statements, including ROIC and leverage ratios.",
