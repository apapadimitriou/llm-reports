    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides high originality by moving beyond headline earnings to offer quantified, company-specific mechanisms for growth and competitive advantage. It features at least four distinct syntheses that are highly decision-relevant. Most notably, the analyst provides an original thesis on pricing power by extracting data from regulatory pricing disclosures (quantifying the 2025 list price at 8.10 bps and the minimum fee at $145,000), which serves as a specific, testable evidence base for the firm's 'wide moat.' Additionally, the report synthesizes the value proposition of the ratings business by contrasting the cost of a rating (~8 bps) against the interest savings for issuers (30-65 bps), providing a clear economic mechanism for the firm's pricing floor. The analysis of the mobility spinoff and the margin trajectory (forecasting 52% by 2029 despite the IHS Markit integration) provides specific, quantified pathways for valuation. Finally, the report offers actionable peer-specific insights, such as using S&P\u2019s Market Intelligence performance as a negative read-through for FactSet. These elements\u2014quantified implications, explicit causal links, and peer contrasts\u2014meet the criteria for an Excellent grade.",
