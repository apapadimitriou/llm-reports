    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded \"Poor\" due to multiple significant internal contradictions and a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst provides explicit assumptions for key drivers\u2014such as a 17% revenue CAGR through 2029, non-GAAP gross margins of 62%-64%, and a 9% WACC\u2014the internal consistency is severely compromised. A major contradiction exists regarding the Fair Value Estimate (FVE) history: the Analyst Note from November 2024 (page 8) claims the FVE was raised to $300, yet the Forecast Revisions table (page 14) lists the prior FVE as $75.44 as of December 2024. Additionally, the report provides conflicting figures for management's 2025 AI revenue targets, citing $750 million on page 1 and $1.5 billion on page 7 without explanation. Justification for these assumptions is often weak, frequently relying on the subjective claim that management guidance is \"conservative\" without providing a detailed bridge or peer benchmarking to support the analyst's significantly higher forecasts (e.g., 23% growth vs. 17% guided). Finally, despite an \"Uncertainty: High\" rating, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for material levers like AI infrastructure spending or tariff impacts. This lack of stress-testing, combined with significant internal data conflicts, results in a \"Poor\" assessment according to the grading rubric.",
