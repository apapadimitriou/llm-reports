    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, covering all required sections from business strategy to capital allocation. It excels in sector-specific depth, providing detailed peak sales estimates for the drug pipeline (e.g., Repatha at $3B, Tezspire at $3B), probability-of-approval adjustments (60% for MariTide), and specific patent cliff dates for Prolia (2025) and Enbrel (2028). The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers\u2014such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) step-downs (2% and 1% respectively) and Medicare negotiations\u2014to the fair value outcome. Peer benchmarking is robust, appearing in both the valuation summary and the ESG analysis. Evidence integration is strong, with claims consistently tied to management guidance or analyst forecasts. However, the report lacks a dedicated, quantitative scenario or sensitivity analysis section (e.g., a table showing FVE under different clinical trial outcomes), which, according to the decision rules, caps the grade at 'Good' rather than 'Excellent'. Redundancy is minimal, with the Analyst Note providing necessary updates to the core sections without excessive repetition.",
