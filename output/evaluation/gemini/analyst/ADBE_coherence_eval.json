    "reasoning": "The report maintains a clear, professional tone and a logical structure, successfully bridging the March 2025 Analyst Note with foundational sections from 2024. The narrative regarding Adobe's generative AI strategy and its 'wide moat' switching costs is consistently applied across the Business Strategy, Moat, and Valuation sections. However, the report suffers from significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the supporting data tables, triggering a hard cap of 'fair.' Specifically, the Forecast Revisions table (page 16) lists 'Prior' 2025 revenue as $21,505 million\u2014a figure identical to 2024 actuals\u2014which implies a 0% growth forecast. This directly contradicts the December 2024 narrative (page 6) which explicitly states the analyst modeled a 10% revenue CAGR. Furthermore, the March 2025 Analyst Note (page 1) forecasts 200 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion over five years, yet the Financials table (page 15) shows GAAP operating margins expanding by 460 basis points (from 34.3% to 38.9%) over the same period. While the distinction between GAAP and non-GAAP is acknowledged, the discrepancy in the magnitude of expansion (more than double) is left unexplained. While the analyst's claim that revenue growth is 'a hair under' double digits is mathematically supported by the 9.94% five-year average, the data alignment issues in the revision history and margin trajectories require the reader to reconcile the numbers themselves.",
    "evidence": [
        "The Forecast Revisions table (p. 16) uses 2024 actuals as 'Prior' 2025 forecasts, contradicting the 12 Dec 2024 narrative (p. 6) of a 10% CAGR.",
        "Analyst Note (p. 1) cites 200 bps of non-GAAP margin expansion, while the Financials table (p. 15) shows 460 bps of GAAP margin expansion.",
        "The 5-year revenue growth average of 9.94% (p. 15) precisely supports the 'hair under' double-digits claim in the Analyst Note (p. 1)."
