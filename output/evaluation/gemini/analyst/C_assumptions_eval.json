    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to multiple significant numeric contradictions between the narrative and the valuation tables, combined with a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst is explicit in stating key assumptions\u2014such as midcycle revenue growth of 2%-3%, a 63% efficiency ratio, and an 8% ROTCE\u2014these figures fail to reconcile with the provided financial models. Specifically, the narrative explicitly cites a 10% cost of equity as a hurdle the bank cannot meet, yet the 'Key Valuation Drivers' table on page 20 utilizes a 9.0% cost of equity. Furthermore, the text forecasts a modest 0.8% growth in Net Interest Income (NII) for 2025, whereas the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table on page 19 projects a 1.5% decline for the same period. Justification is qualitatively solid, leveraging segment-specific analysis (TTS, Markets, USPB) and historical context to challenge management's guidance. However, the report fails the 'stress-tested' pillar entirely. Despite identifying Citigroup as being on the 'higher end of Medium' uncertainty and noting risks from interest rate cycles and credit disruptions, there are no quantified sensitivity tables or bull/bear scenarios illustrating the impact of these variables on the $75 fair value estimate. Per the grading rubric, the presence of two distinct numeric contradictions, combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities, necessitates a 'Poor' rating.",
