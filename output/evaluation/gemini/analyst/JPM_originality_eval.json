    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high originality through four distinct syntheses that provide actionable, company-specific perspectives. First, it moves beyond headline earnings to present a testable thesis regarding the timing of tariff-related disruptions, predicting that the 'alarm' sounded by management will manifest as visible financial impact in Q2 provisions. Second, it provides a deep-dive into the bank's deposit franchise, quantifying JPMorgan's 54% deposit growth against the 32% industry average (2019-2024) to substantiate its cost-advantage moat. Third, the valuation section avoids boilerplate by providing a quantified, multi-year trajectory for Net Interest Margin (NIM) and Net Interest Income (NII), explicitly linking a 2.2% NII decline in 2026 to a specific 2.50% fed-funds rate target. Finally, it synthesizes the bank's $15 billion technology budget with structural efficiency ratio targets, explaining how scale allows for higher investment levels without margin degradation. While the report contains some standard Morningstar boilerplate regarding 'scale and diversification' and generic macro risks, the core analytical notes provide significant value-added interpretation of data points into decision-relevant conclusions.",
