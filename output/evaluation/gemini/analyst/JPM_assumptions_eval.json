    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and highly specific assumptions for key drivers, including Net Interest Margin (NIM), expense growth, and Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE). These inputs are well-justified through a combination of 10-year historical averages, peer benchmarking (particularly regarding deposit market share), and management's own long-term guidance. The internal consistency is excellent; the detailed narrative in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section reconciles accurately with the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table, with only minor rounding differences in the display. However, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for its material drivers within the text. While it qualitatively discusses risks such as interest rate cycles, regulatory changes, and technological disruption, it does not model the specific valuation impact of variations in these levers (e.g., a bull/bear case or a rate sensitivity table). Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers necessitates a hard cap of 'Fair,' despite the high quality of the stated inputs and justifications.",
