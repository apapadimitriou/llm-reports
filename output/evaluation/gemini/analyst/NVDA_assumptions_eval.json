    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high explicitness and specificity in its assumptions. Key drivers, such as the $5.5 billion inventory write-off and the reduction of China-based revenue to near zero, are clearly stated with specific magnitudes and time horizons. The analyst provides a granular quarterly revenue path for the Data Center segment and justifies long-term growth rates (11%-12%) by linking them to hyperscaler capital expenditure trends. Internal consistency is excellent; the figures cited in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' narrative reconcile perfectly with the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table. However, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based valuation ranges for its material drivers. While the 'Risk and Uncertainty' section qualitatively discusses threats like in-house chip development by tech titans and the impact of DeepSeek, it does not translate these risks into specific valuation impacts (e.g., a bear-case FVE). Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers imposes a hard cap, limiting the final grade to 'Fair' despite the high quality of the explicit inputs.",
