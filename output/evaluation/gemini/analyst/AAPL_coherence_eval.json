    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a 'fair' grade due to significant internal contradictions between the most recent Analyst Note and the supporting financial tables. The Analyst Note dated 2 May 2025 explicitly states, 'We lowered our short-term profit forecast to reflect direct tariff costs,' yet the 'Forecast Revisions' table on page 16 shows that the 'Current' and 'Prior' (30 Jan 2025) data for revenue, operating income, and EPS are identical. This suggests the narrative update was not actually integrated into the quantitative model presented in the report. Furthermore, while the Analyst Note claims to 'maintain' the $200 fair value estimate, the FVE date remains 1 Nov 2024, indicating the valuation has not been formally refreshed in six months despite the 'material risk' from tariffs discussed in the May 2025 update. Structural coherence is weakened by the age of the core sections. The 'Business Strategy' and 'Economic Moat' sections date back to February 2024, and the 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' section from November 2024 does not reflect the specific tariff concerns or the 'Apple Intelligence' rollout strategy mentioned in the 2025 Analyst Notes. This creates a disjointed reading experience where the 'bottom line' in the intro relies on data and risks (like the 25% downside tariff scenario) that are entirely absent from the formal Risk and Bulls/Bears sections. While the prose is clear, the failure to reconcile the 2025 narrative with the 2024/early 2025 tables is a decisive flaw.",
    "evidence": [
        "The Analyst Note (p. 1) claims to have 'lowered our short-term profit forecast,' but the Forecast Revisions table (p. 16) shows no change from the 30 Jan 2025 data.",
        "The Analyst Note (p. 1) states 'We see shares as fairly valued,' contradicting the Feb 19, 2025 note (p. 9) which states 'We continue to see shares as overvalued' at the same $200 FVE.",
        "The 2 May 2025 Analyst Note introduces a '25% gross downside risk' from tariffs, which is not reconciled or mentioned in the 1 Nov 2024 Risk or Bears sections."
