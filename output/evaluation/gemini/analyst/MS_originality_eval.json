    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a comprehensive overview of Morgan Stanley's quarterly performance and long-term strategy but relies heavily on restating public data and generic sector themes. The primary insights\u2014such as the mean reversion of trading revenue, the cyclical recovery of investment banking, and the strategic shift toward wealth management\u2014are standard industry perspectives rather than original theses. While the 'Analyst Notes Archive' contains some higher-level synthesis regarding direct indexing and tariff impacts, the core report (Analyst Note and Strategy sections) contains more than five instances of restated or generic insights. Specifically, the discussion of Basel III impacts and the 'scale and diversification' benefits of the E-Trade/Eaton Vance acquisitions are boilerplate. Furthermore, the valuation section utilizes a standard DCF model with conventional drivers (AUM growth, NII normalization) and lacks a novel mechanism or company-specific angle that differentiates it from consensus. Per the decision rules, the presence of more than three generic/restated insights and the lack of a novel valuation driver cap the grade at 'Fair'.",
