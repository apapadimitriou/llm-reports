    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to multiple unresolved numeric contradictions between the narrative and the valuation tables, compounded by a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst explicitly states key assumptions\u2014such as a 6% organic growth rate and a 52% long-term margin\u2014these figures fail to reconcile with the provided financial models. Specifically, the narrative claims a 2024 margin of 49% and forecasts a 300-basis-point expansion to reach 52% by 2029. However, the valuation table on page 14 reports a 2024 Adjusted EBITDA margin of 47.7% and an Operating Margin of 38.6%, neither of which matches the 49% starting point. Furthermore, the table's projected expansion to 2029 represents either a 450-basis-point or a 920-basis-point increase, directly contradicting the '300-basis-point' claim in the text. Additionally, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for material drivers like interest rates or bond issuance volumes, which are identified as primary risks. Per the grading instructions, the combination of at least one distinct numeric contradiction and the lack of quantified sensitivities mandates a 'Poor' rating, as the outputs function as a 'black box' that cannot be audited against the report's own data.",
