    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of comprehensiveness, covering all core content areas required for a bank equity research report. It includes a detailed Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy, and a robust Economic Moat analysis that justifies the 'Wide' rating through cost advantages and switching costs. Sector-specific KPIs for the banking industry\u2014including Net Interest Margin (NIM), Net Interest Income (NII), Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE), Efficiency Ratio, and Loan Loss Provisions\u2014are consistently reported in both the narrative and the multi-year Financials Snapshot. The valuation section provides an explicit bridge from operating drivers, such as NIM compression and expense-cutting initiatives, to the Fair Value Estimate of $65. Peer benchmarking is present, comparing Wells Fargo against major rivals like JPMorgan and Bank of America across valuation multiples and ESG risk ratings. Evidence integration is strong, with references to external data sources like Dealogic and Cerulli. While the report mentions a 'bear-case scenario' regarding tariff impacts in the Analyst Note archive and provides qualitative 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' scenarios, it lacks a dedicated, quantitative sensitivity analysis table or a multi-scenario valuation bridge (e.g., Bull/Bear price targets) within the main body. According to the decision rules, the presence of all major sections and KPIs without a formal quantitative sensitivity analysis results in a 'Good' grade. The report is professional, well-structured, and avoids superficial redundancy, providing sufficient depth for an informed investment evaluation.",
