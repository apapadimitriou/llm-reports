    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a grade of fair due to a significant, unaddressed contradiction between the narrative and the financial tables, which triggers a mandatory hard cap under the grading rubric. In the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section, the analyst explicitly references a 'non-GAAP operating margin expanding from 30% in 2024 (actual).' However, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table on page 15 lists the 'Operating Margin %' for the 2024 actual period as 12.4%. While an experienced reader might infer that the narrative uses non-GAAP figures while the table uses GAAP, the report fails to label the table as GAAP or provide any reconciliation between these two 'actual' figures. This creates internal noise and forces the reader to resolve the discrepancy themselves. Beyond this contradiction, the report demonstrates strong structural coherence. The 'Analyst Note' effectively bridges the Q1 2025 earnings results with the fair value estimate increase from $990 to $1,010, citing specific drivers like generative AI adoption and federal demand. The narrative flow within the 'Business Strategy' and 'Economic Moat' sections is logical, clearly outlining the 'land-and-expand' model. However, the 'Economic Moat' section\u2014dated a full year prior to the report\u2014contains stale data points, such as ACV percentages from 2020, which feel disconnected from the 2025 context. Despite these narrative strengths, the lack of alignment between the primary margin assumptions and the provided financial data necessitates the fair rating.",
    "evidence": [
        "Narrative states 'non-GAAP operating margin expanding from 30% in 2024 (actual)' (Fair Value and Profit Drivers, Page 7) vs. table showing 'Operating Margin %' of 12.4% for 2024 (Financials, Page 15).",
        "The 'Economic Moat' section (Page 6) relies on stale data, stating 'We estimate emerging products generated 35% of ACV in 2020,' which is five years old relative to the report date.",
        "Strong temporal alignment in the Analyst Note (Page 1) connecting Q1 2025 results to 'modernization efforts continue with DOGE,' a timely 2025 reference."
