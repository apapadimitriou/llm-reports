    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high originality through multiple syntheses and a specific original thesis. It moves beyond the headline of China export restrictions by quantifying the $5.5 billion H20 write-off and its 300-basis-point impact on gross margins, while specifically arguing why these chips cannot be repurposed for developed markets. The analyst presents a distinct, testable thesis regarding a PC CPU launch in fiscal 2027, projecting a specific revenue jump to $17 billion. Furthermore, the report synthesizes the emergence of efficient AI models (DeepSeek) into a 'lower cost = higher demand' framework, providing a counter-intuitive perspective on competitive threats. The valuation is not generic; it includes a specific 'demand pause' modeled for fiscal 2029, showing a willingness to deviate from straight-line growth assumptions. While it contains some standard moat descriptions, the event-driven analysis and long-term product roadmap provide significant value-add for decision-making with clear mechanisms and quantified catalysts.",
