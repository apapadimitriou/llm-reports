    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides exhaustive qualitative coverage, particularly in the 'Economic Moat' section which details every business segment from Search to 'Other Bets.' It includes essential components like Bull/Bear scenarios with specific price targets and a peer benchmarking table. However, the report is constrained by a generic 'Financials Snapshot' table. While the text mentions sector-specific KPIs such as Google Cloud growth (28%) and Traffic Acquisition Costs (20-23%), these are entirely absent from the multi-year financial summary table on page 19, which only provides consolidated figures. Additionally, several high-level market share claims (e.g., 80% search market share, 2 billion YouTube users, and Android's two-thirds market share) lack specific citations or data sources. There is also significant redundancy, as the primary Analyst Note is repeated verbatim within the Analyst Notes Archive. Per the grading instructions, the omission of core sector KPIs from the financial snapshot and the presence of multiple uncited material claims trigger hard caps. Despite the depth of the qualitative analysis and the inclusion of scenario and peer analysis, these structural and evidentiary gaps limit the final grade to 'Fair'.",
