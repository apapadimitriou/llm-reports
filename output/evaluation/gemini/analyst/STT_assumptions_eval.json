    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid explicitness and specificity regarding its near-term 2025 assumptions. Key drivers such as fee revenue growth (3%-5%), net interest income (flat to 1%), and adjusted expense growth (2%-3%) are clearly stated and proximal to the forecasts. Justification is a strength, as the analyst provides historical context for pricing headwinds (citing specific percentages from 2018 through 2024) and explains the impact of the BlackRock iShares transition. Internal consistency is maintained across the document; the narrative's expectation of 'flat' to '1%' NII growth reconciles with the 0.9% figure in the valuation table.\n\nHowever, the report is limited by a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst qualitatively identifies risks\u2014such as the sensitivity of asset-based fees to market levels and the flexibility of variable expenses (estimated at one-third of the total)\u2014there are no quantified ranges or scenario tables showing how specific changes in market indices or interest rates would impact the fair value estimate. The 'Risk and Uncertainty' section remains descriptive rather than mathematical. Additionally, while the Cost of Equity is stated as 9.0% in the valuation summary table, the report lacks a cited source or build-up for this parameter. Per the mandatory hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers restricts the final grade to 'Fair.'",
