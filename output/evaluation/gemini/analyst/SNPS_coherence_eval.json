    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates exceptional structural and narrative coherence. The Analyst Note (May 29, 2025) immediately addresses a major geopolitical shift regarding a potential China EDA ban, explicitly stating that this has moved from a 'risk' to the 'base case.' This narrative shift is meticulously carried through the entire report: the Fair Value Estimate is lowered from $550 to $510, and the financial tables reflect a significant deceleration in 2025 revenue growth (4.9% vs. 15.0% in 2024) to account for the $0 China revenue assumption by year-end. Transitions between sections are smooth, with the Business Strategy section providing the necessary context for the long-term AI tailwinds that offset the immediate China headwinds. The Economic Moat section provides a deep, connected argument for switching costs and intangible assets, which justifies the low 7.5% cost of equity used in the valuation. While the lead Analyst Note mentions peer Cadence's revenue exposure, it clearly distinguishes this from Synopsys's own 10-15% exposure mentioned in the Risk and Archive sections. The report proactively resolves the tension between the 'Bear' case (China risk) and the 'Base' case (valuation) by incorporating the ban into the FVE. Terminology like EDA, IP, and multi-die architectures is used consistently throughout, and the Forecast Revisions table perfectly matches the narrative changes.",
    "evidence": [
        "Our fair value estimate assumes that sales to China drop to $0 by the end of the year... Our updated valuation for Synopsys is $510 (Analyst Note, p. 1-2).",
        "We think the current series of events increases the probability above 50% that EDA sales to China will be banned, and it is now our base case (Analyst Note, p. 1).",
        "Financials table shows 2025 revenue growth forecast at 4.9%, down from 15.0% in 2024, aligning with the China exit narrative (Financials, p. 15)."
