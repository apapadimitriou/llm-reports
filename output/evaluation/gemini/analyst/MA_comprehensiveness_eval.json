    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Fair' primarily due to the omission of core sector-specific KPIs in the Financials Snapshot and significant redundancy across sections. While the report includes all mandatory sections and provides high-quality qualitative analysis, it fails to meet the 'Good' criteria because the multi-year financial table on page 12 is generic. It lacks essential payment industry metrics such as Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), Cross-border Volume, and Switched Transactions, which are only mentioned sporadically in the text. According to the grading rubric, the absence of two or more core sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot triggers a hard cap at 'Fair.'\n\nFurthermore, the report exhibits substantial redundancy. The 'Analyst Note' and 'Business Strategy & Outlook' sections repeat nearly identical language regarding the normalization of travel recovery and the fading tailwinds of cross-border transactions without providing additional depth or new data in the subsequent mentions. The valuation section is well-structured, explicitly linking a 12% revenue CAGR and margin expansion to the $500 fair value estimate, and peer benchmarking is clearly presented. However, the lack of a company-specific scenario or sensitivity analysis table\u2014despite the methodology's mention of such tools\u2014further prevents a higher grade. The sourcing is consistent with Morningstar\u2019s internal standards, but the repetitive narrative and generic financial data presentation limit the report's overall comprehensiveness.",
