    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for its primary revenue drivers, particularly the Farapulse and Watchman franchises. The analyst justifies the 11% average annual revenue growth through 2029 by citing strong Q1 performance, competitive dynamics (such as Johnson & Johnson's launch pause), and specific product adoption rates. Margin assumptions are also specific, with a projected peak of 27% in 2029, and the report explicitly accounts for a $200 million tariff headwind. Internal consistency is high; the narrative figures for growth and margins reconcile closely with the detailed 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table. However, the report fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While it identifies risks qualitatively (e.g., competition from J&J, product recalls), it does not provide ranges or scenarios showing how changes in key inputs would impact the $93 fair value estimate. Furthermore, while valuation parameters like the 8.6% WACC and 10.5% Stage II growth rate are stated in the tables, they lack explicit justification or linkage to market benchmarks within the text. Per the hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivities on material drivers limits the grade to 'Fair'.",
