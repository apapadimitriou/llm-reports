    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a high level of qualitative detail, particularly in the Economic Moat and Business Strategy sections, which offer a deep dive into Amazon's competitive advantages across its retail, cloud (AWS), and advertising segments. All mandatory sections, including Capital Allocation and ESG Risk Rating, are present and well-structured. The valuation section successfully links long-term operating drivers, such as the shift to e-commerce and AWS growth, to the fair value estimate. However, the report is constrained by significant omissions in the Financials Snapshot table. Despite the text highlighting AWS and Advertising as the primary profit engines, the multi-year forecast table on page 16 is generic, providing only consolidated figures. It lacks a specific breakdown of AWS revenue, AWS operating margins, and Advertising revenue, which are the essential sector-specific KPIs for evaluating Amazon's performance. Furthermore, while the appendix describes a scenario analysis methodology, the report lacks an actual sensitivity or scenario table within the main body to illustrate how changes in key assumptions would impact the valuation. According to the grading rubric's hard caps, the absence of at least two core sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot table\u2014specifically the segmented revenue and margin data for AWS and Advertising\u2014requires a maximum grade of Fair. The lack of explicit scenario analysis further prevents a higher rating.",
