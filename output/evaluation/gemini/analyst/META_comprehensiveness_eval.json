    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides high-quality qualitative analysis, particularly within the 'Economic Moat' and 'Capital Allocation' sections, which offer deep dives into Meta's network effects, data advantages, and management's reinvestment strategy. It includes robust peer benchmarking and a detailed ESG risk assessment. However, the report is subject to a hard cap of 'Fair' because the 'Financials Snapshot' table (Page 15) is generic and omits core sector-specific KPIs such as Monthly Active Users (MAU), Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), and Ad Impressions. While these metrics are mentioned sporadically in the text, their absence from the multi-year forecast and historical data table constitutes a significant gap in sector-appropriate quantitative coverage. Additionally, there is substantial redundancy between the 'Business Strategy & Outlook' and 'Economic Moat' sections, which repeat descriptions of the 'Family of Apps' and Reality Labs' losses with minimal new depth. Finally, while a specific sensitivity note regarding a TikTok ban is included in the Analyst Note archive, the report lacks a formal, dedicated scenario or sensitivity analysis section for the primary valuation estimate.",
