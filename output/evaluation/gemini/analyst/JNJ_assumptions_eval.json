    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report receives a 'Poor' grade due to multiple significant internal contradictions between the narrative claims and the provided financial data, alongside a lack of robust, quantified sensitivity analysis for the valuation. First, the report explicitly states that J&J's free cash flow is 'over 20% of sales,' yet the 'Margins & Returns' table shows actual historical FCF margins of -4.8%, -1.4%, and 1.4% for 2022-2024, respectively. Second, the narrative forecasts 'fairly flat operating margins over the next several years,' but the valuation model summary projects a steady expansion from 24.9% in 2024 to 29.1% by 2029\u2014a 420-basis-point increase that contradicts the 'flat' description. While the report provides specific assumptions for R&D spending, legal costs (3% of net income), and tax rates (19%), these are undermined by the lack of consistency. Furthermore, the report fails to provide a quantified sensitivity table or scenario analysis showing how changes in material drivers (like WACC, terminal growth, or drug pricing) would impact the $164 Fair Value Estimate. Although an analyst note provides a specific quantified scenario for potential tariffs, this does not constitute a comprehensive stress-test of the core valuation model. Per the grading instructions, two or more distinct contradictions between text and tables mandate a 'Poor' rating.",
