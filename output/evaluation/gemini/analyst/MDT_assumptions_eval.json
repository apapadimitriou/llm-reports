    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for its primary valuation drivers, including a 4% revenue CAGR through fiscal 2029 and a 200-basis-point operating margin expansion. These are justified qualitatively through the discussion of new product cycles such as renal denervation and pulsed field ablation. The report also clearly defines its cost of capital (WACC 7.1%) and long-run tax rate (18%) within a dedicated valuation table. However, the report fails to meet the criteria for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade due to a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for its material drivers. While the methodology section describes the use of scenario analysis, the report itself provides only a single-point fair value estimate without demonstrating how variations in growth or margin would impact the $112 valuation. Furthermore, there is a minor internal numeric inconsistency: the narrative explicitly forecasts operating margins peaking at 21% in fiscal 2029, whereas the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table lists the 2029 operating margin at 20.5%. This contradiction, combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities, triggers the hard cap for a 'Fair' rating. The justification for the margin expansion is also somewhat hand-wavy, relying on the 'shedding of legacy businesses' without providing a detailed bridge or historical peer comparison to support the specific 200-basis-point magnitude.",
