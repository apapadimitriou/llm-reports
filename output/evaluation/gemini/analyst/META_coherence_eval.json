    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates exceptional coherence, functioning as a unified argument across multiple dates and sections. The narrative flow is seamless, utilizing sophisticated transitions to link Meta\u2019s competitive advantages to its financial outcomes. For instance, the Economic Moat section explicitly connects data collection to pricing power, which is then reflected in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section\u2019s forecast of rising average revenue per user. Internal consistency is a major strength. Financial figures cited in the narrative, such as the $49 billion net cash position at the end of 2024 and the 42% operating margins, align perfectly with the detailed Morningstar Valuation Model Summary table. The analyst also maintains temporal precision; the May 1, 2025, note correctly identifies Alphabet\u2019s and Snap\u2019s recent earnings reports relative to Meta\u2019s own Q1 results. Furthermore, the report proactively reconciles conflicting viewpoints. The Bulls Say and Bears Say sections are not isolated lists but are integrated into the Risk and Uncertainty and Fair Value narratives. The base-case valuation of $770 is clearly justified by the analyst\u2019s more optimistic view of generative AI investments, while the High uncertainty rating accounts for the Bears' concerns regarding Reality Labs' capital burn and antitrust litigation. There are no material contradictions between the text and the quantitative data, making the argument highly persuasive and easy to follow.",
    "evidence": [
        "Meta's leverage ratios remain exceptionally strong, with $49 billion in net cash... as of the end of 2024 (Capital Allocation, Page 7) matches the $48,989M net cash calculated from the Valuation Model (Page 16).",
        "The report links product strategy to financial drivers: 'Such improvements/additions not only improve user engagement, but also allow Meta to monetize these features/products by layering advertisements onto them' (Business Strategy & Outlook, Page 2).",
        "Temporal accuracy is maintained in the May 1, 2025 note, correctly referencing Snap's 'uncertain outlook reported yesterday' (Analyst Note, Page 1) and Alphabet's results from the previous week."
