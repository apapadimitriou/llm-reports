    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits strong thematic coherence by linking the clinical success of the Farapulse and Watchman platforms to Boston Scientific\u2019s competitive positioning and valuation. The narrative flows logically from the immediate impact of Q1 2025 results to long-term strategic shifts away from mature markets like stents. The analyst effectively reconciles Bear case concerns regarding TAVR headwinds and the lower moat of the stent business with the base-case valuation assumptions. However, the report suffers from significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the quantitative tables. Most notably, the Analyst Note claims that the fair value estimate was increased due to 'higher projections' for 2025-2026, yet the Forecast Revisions table on page 14 shows that revenue and operating income forecasts for those years were actually revised downward compared to the February 2025 data. Furthermore, the narrative consistently cites a prior fair value estimate of $84.00, while the revisions table lists it as $86.17. There is also a minor discrepancy regarding the 2029 operating margin, which is described as peaking at 27% in the text but projected at 27.5% in the financials table. These unresolved tensions between the stated investment thesis and the supporting data tables undermine the report's overall reliability. Per the grading instructions, the presence of unaddressed contradictions between assumptions, tables, and narrative requires a hard cap at the 'fair' grade level.",
