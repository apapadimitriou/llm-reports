        "summary_reasoning": "The report earns a 'Fair' grade. While it explicitly states key drivers such as a 3% average annual revenue growth rate and a 7.5% cost of equity, it fails to meet the higher standards for consistency and sensitivity analysis. A primary deficiency is the lack of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers like trading volume or average rate per contract; the report discusses these risks qualitatively but provides no valuation impact ranges. Furthermore, a distinct internal contradiction exists regarding the operating margin: the narrative forecasts an increase to 63.2% by 2028, whereas the 'Margins & Returns' table explicitly models 64.2% for that same year. Justification for assumptions is partial, relying on historical volatility trends and the 2020-2022 retail surge, but lacks rigorous peer benchmarking or cited external sources for the specific growth magnitudes. Specificity is generally solid, with clear units and a five-year time horizon (2024-2029) for most inputs. However, the combination of a numeric discrepancy and the absence of quantified stress-testing triggers the 'Fair' hard cap. The model remains somewhat of a 'black box' regarding how specific shifts in market volatility would alter the $245 fair value estimate.",
