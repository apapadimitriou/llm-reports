    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive statistics to explain the underlying drivers of Bank of America's performance. It provides clear causal mechanisms for Net Interest Income (NII) growth, noting \"NII grew 3%... thanks to lower deposit costs\" and \"NII... bottomed out... driven by fixed-rate asset repricing.\" The analyst explicitly benchmarks assumptions, comparing the bank's efficiency ratio\u2014projected to \"improve to high-50s... compared with mid-60s\"\u2014against its peer JPMorgan (53%). Inference quality is high, with a clear thesis that the bank is underearning due to duration risk. Uncertainty is addressed through a specific Analyst Note regarding US tariffs, which provides a quantified scenario: \"midteens percentage fair value estimate decrease... bear-case scenario.\" The report also includes a comprehensive 10-year valuation model with explicit forecasts, such as \"ROTE of around 14% compared with... COE of 9.5%.\" Actionable implications are clear, identifying the stock as a \"preferred choice\" while noting \"Trading should remain strong... due to higher volatility.\" The report successfully links macroeconomic turbulence to specific bank outcomes, providing a robust framework for investor decision-making.",
