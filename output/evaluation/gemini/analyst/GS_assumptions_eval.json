    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple unresolved numeric contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, combined with a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. Specifically, the narrative explicitly forecasts a decline in Net Interest Income (NII) due to rate normalization and balance sheet shrinkage, yet the valuation summary table projects NII growing by over 32% from $8,056 million in 2024 to $10,660 million by 2027. Furthermore, the analyst stipulates a long-run operating margin of 34%, but the provided efficiency ratios in the model summary (ranging from 61.6% to 63.6%) imply significantly higher operating margins of 36.4% to 38.4%. While the report provides specific compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) for revenue (2.0%) and investment banking (3.2%), these inputs are undermined by the lack of internal consistency. Justification is only partial, often relying on qualitative assessments of 'market mania' or 'elevated levels' without detailed peer benchmarking or historical data reconciliation. Finally, the report fails the requirement for quantified stress-testing; while it identifies macroeconomic risks like tariffs, it provides no company-specific sensitivity tables or scenario ranges showing the impact of material drivers on the $490 fair value estimate, rendering the output a 'black box.'",
