    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the financial model, alongside a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. The analyst explicitly forecasts a 9% net revenue CAGR and a 70-basis-point annual improvement in net operating margins in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section. However, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table contradicts these claims, showing a 10.2% revenue CAGR and a total operating margin expansion of only 50 basis points over the entire five-year forecast period (averaging 10 basis points per year). These discrepancies suggest a lack of internal coherence between the report's qualitative narrative and its quantitative valuation model. Furthermore, while the report identifies material risks\u2014including macroeconomic sensitivity, regulatory antitrust suits, and shifting consumer spending\u2014it provides no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for these drivers. The 'Medium' uncertainty rating and the resulting 1-star/5-star price ranges are generic outputs of the Morningstar methodology and do not constitute a stress-test of specific model inputs. Although assumptions for the cost of equity (9%), tax rate (21%), and Stage II growth (8%) are stated, they lack specific justification or evidence-rich benchmarking. The combination of multiple numeric contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a Poor grade.",
