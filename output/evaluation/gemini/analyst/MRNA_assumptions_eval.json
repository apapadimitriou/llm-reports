    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and highly specific assumptions, particularly regarding long-term revenue targets ($14B by 2034) and probability-adjusted sales for specific pipeline modalities, such as $3B for oncology and $1B for rare diseases. These inputs are well-justified through historical pandemic sales data, management's updated cost-cutting guidance ($1.4B-$1.7B reduction), and peer benchmarks for the 9% WACC. Internal consistency is high; narrative forecasts for 2028 revenue ($5.5B) and operating margins (>30% by 2031) reconcile perfectly with the detailed Valuation Model Summary table. However, the report fails to provide quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for its most material drivers, such as the probability of success for the oncology pipeline or the long-term adoption rate of COVID-19 boosters. While it assigns a 'Very High' uncertainty rating and mentions a negligible (<10%) valuation impact from ESG risks, it lacks a robust sensitivity matrix or bull/bear case quantification for the primary revenue levers. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities on material drivers necessitates a 'Fair' grade, despite the high quality of explicitness and justification found elsewhere in the document.",
