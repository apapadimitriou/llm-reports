    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of narrative sophistication and structural logic, effectively connecting the bank's regulatory progress with its valuation and moat. The analyst provides a clear 'defense to offense' transition story, supported by specific segment analysis (Wealth Management, Retail Banking). Transitions between sections are generally smooth, and the Bulls/Bears cases are well-integrated into the base-case valuation assumptions, particularly regarding the 2026 asset cap removal. However, the report suffers from significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the 'Valuation Model Summary' table, triggering a 'fair' grade cap. Specifically, the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section (dated 3 Apr 2025) states that NIM is expected to compress to 2.70% in 2025 from 2.73% in 2024. In contrast, the summary table lists the 2024 NIM as 3.1%, a material discrepancy. Furthermore, the 'Growth & Ratios' section of the table contains mathematical errors or misalignments; for instance, it lists 2025 NII growth as -9.0%, even though the NII dollar values in the same table show an increase from $47,676 million in 2024 to $48,293 million in 2025 (approx. +1.3%). These data-narrative mismatches undermine the report's quantitative coherence. While the qualitative analysis is 'excellent,' the failure to reconcile the primary financial table with the text necessitates a 'fair' rating.",
