    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high quality of assumptions, characterized by strong explicitness and specificity. Key value drivers, particularly the GLP-1 market trajectory and margin expansion, are clearly defined with specific magnitudes, such as a $200 billion total market by 2031 and net price declines from $7,000 to $3,000. Justification is solid, utilizing industry benchmarks for R&D spending (low-to-mid 20s vs. high-teens average) and peer-aligned WACC (7.3%). Internal consistency is maintained throughout, with the detailed financial tables on page 13 reconciling with the narrative's double-digit growth and margin expansion forecasts. Sensitivity analysis is present and quantified for critical material drivers; for instance, the analyst explicitly states that orforglipron peak sales could double to $20 billion based on clinical data and quantifies a 200-basis-point margin headwind from potential tariffs. While the report lacks a formal sensitivity matrix for WACC or terminal growth rates, the quantification of specific product-level and macro-level scenarios provides sufficient transparency into the 'cone of uncertainty' mentioned by the analyst. The assumptions are proximal to the forecasts they drive, making the model's logic traceable and auditable.",
