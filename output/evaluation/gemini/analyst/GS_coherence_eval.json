    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded fair due to a significant internal contradiction between the narrative assumptions and the provided valuation table regarding Net Interest Income (NII). In the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section (dated 21 Mar 2025), the analyst explicitly states a forecast for NII to decline on the back of rate normalization. However, the Morningstar Valuation Model Summary table shows NII increasing from $8,056 million in 2024 to $10,660 million by 2027\u2014a nearly 32% increase\u2014before finally declining in the outer years (2028-2029). This creates a confusing argument where the text suggests immediate pressure while the model projects multi-year growth. Structurally, the report is well-organized, with the April 14 Analyst Note successfully integrating recent macroeconomic events, such as the April 3 tariff announcements, into the Q1 2025 earnings context. The Economic Moat and Capital Allocation sections provide deep, connected narrative analysis rather than simple lists. However, the Bulls Say section suggests that more stable net interest income could drive a premium, which is never reconciled with the base-case narrative of declining NII or the table's projected volatility. While the language is clear and the temporal references to recent events are accurate, the quantitative-narrative mismatch regarding a key profit driver necessitates a fair grade under the provided guardrails.",
    "evidence": [
        "\"We also forecast net interest income to decline on the back of rate normalization\" (Fair Value and Profit Drivers) vs. table showing NII rising from $8,056M in 2024 to $10,660M in 2027.",
        "The \"Bulls Say\" claim of \"more stable... net interest income\" is not reconciled with the \"Fair Value\" section's forecast of NII decline or the table's projected volatility.",
        "The Analyst Note (14 Apr 2025) correctly references the \"recent selloff\" and \"tariff policies\" detailed in the 3 Apr 2025 archive note, maintaining temporal coherence."
