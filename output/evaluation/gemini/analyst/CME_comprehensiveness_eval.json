    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally sound and covers all required sections, including a particularly robust and detailed analysis of the company's Economic Moat and Capital Allocation. The analyst provides a clear narrative link between macroeconomic drivers\u2014such as interest rate uncertainty and market volatility\u2014and the resulting impact on trading volumes and valuation. Peer benchmarking is present through both a competitor valuation table and a dedicated ESG peer analysis. However, the report is subject to a 'Fair' grade due to a hard cap regarding sector-specific KPIs. While the text discusses Average Daily Volume (ADV) and Rate Per Contract (RPC) qualitatively, these core sector KPIs are entirely absent from the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' (Financials Snapshot) table, which remains generic. Per the evaluation instructions, the omission of two or more core sector KPIs from the Financials Snapshot limits the grade to 'Fair'. Additionally, the report lacks a formal scenario or sensitivity analysis table, which is expected for higher grades. There is also notable redundancy between the 'Bears Say' and 'Risk and Uncertainty' sections, which both repeat the same talking point regarding the transactional nature of the business and its exposure to market forces without providing significant new depth in the latter section.",
