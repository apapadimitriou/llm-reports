    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded \"Poor\" due to the application of strict hard caps regarding internal consistency and sensitivity analysis. While the report is highly explicit in stating its key assumptions\u2014such as an 8% revenue CAGR through 2030 and a 92% historical retention rate\u2014it contains a significant unresolved numeric contradiction between the narrative and the financial tables. Specifically, the narrative cites a 31% \"actual\" non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2024 and targets an expansion to the \"upper 30% area\" by 2030. In contrast, the primary \"Morningstar Valuation Model Summary\" table reports a 14.4% operating margin for 2024 and forecasts a 26.2% margin for 2030. This ~1,600 basis point discrepancy is never reconciled with a GAAP-to-non-GAAP bridge, creating a direct conflict between the \"actual\" figures presented in different parts of the report. Furthermore, the report provides no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling (e.g., Bull/Bear cases) for material drivers like revenue growth or margin expansion, offering only qualitative risk discussion. Per the grading instructions, the presence of a distinct numeric contradiction combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a \"Poor\" grade, as the model's core margin driver remains a \"black box\" relative to the narrative's claims.",
