    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates exceptional coherence, seamlessly integrating a significant valuation change across all sections. The Analyst Note (April 16, 2025) clearly explains the $5 reduction in Fair Value to $125, citing $5.5 billion in H20 GPU write-offs and the loss of the China market. This narrative is meticulously supported in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section, which details the specific reduction in fiscal 2026 Data Center revenue from $183 billion to $163 billion. These figures align perfectly with the Forecast Revisions table on page 17, which shows a total revenue cut from $201.6 billion to $181.6 billion. Furthermore, the narrative's mention of a 57% operating margin for FY2026 is reflected in the Morningstar Valuation Model Summary table (57.1%). Transitions are logical, moving from the immediate catalyst of China restrictions to the long-term moat of Cuda switching costs and finally to the quantitative impact on the DCF model. Temporal references are accurate; the report correctly identifies the January 2025 DeepSeek event and March 2025 GTC conference as recent relative to the April 2025 report date. The Bulls and Bears are well-reconciled, with the base-case valuation explicitly accounting for the Bear concern regarding geopolitical restrictions while maintaining the Bull thesis on developed market AI buildouts.",
    "evidence": [
        "\"We lower our fair value estimate... to $125 from $130 as we cut our revenue estimates to exclude China\" (Analyst Note, p. 1) matches the Forecast Revisions table (p. 17).",
        "\"We anticipate that GAAP operating margins will be 57% in fiscal 2026\" (Fair Value and Profit Drivers, p. 9) is consistent with the 57.1% forecast in the Valuation Model Summary (p. 16).",
        "The reduction of Data Center revenue from $183 billion to $163 billion (p. 8) perfectly reconciles with the $20 billion total revenue revision in the financials table (p. 17)."
