    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded as fair primarily due to significant temporal inconsistencies and unaddressed contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables. Although the report is dated May 7, 2025, the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section is dated July 22, 2024, and still contains the statement, 'We forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2023.' This is a glaring temporal inaccuracy, as 2023 and 2024 results are already finalized and presented as 'Actual' in the Morningstar Valuation Model Summary table. This creates a disconnect where the narrative is predicting the past.\n\nAdditionally, the Bulls/Bears section is also nearly a year old (July 2024) and has not been reconciled with the 2025 Analyst Note's emphasis on AI agents and the NVIDIA partnership. While the Analyst Note provides a fresh look at Q1 2025 results and raises the long-term CAGR to 7%, the underlying valuation narrative remains anchored in 2024 data. The financial table itself shows a 5-year CAGR of 6.8%, which slightly conflicts with the 7% mentioned in the May 2025 note and the 5% mentioned in the February 2025 note. These unresolved tensions between the updated financial models and the stale narrative sections force the reader to assemble the current investment case themselves, violating the requirement for a connected, coherent argument.",
    "evidence": [
        "\"We forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2023\" (Fair Value and Profit Drivers / Page 6) - stale forecast in a report dated May 2025.",
        "\"We are raising our fair value estimate to $268 per share from $250\" (Fair Value and Profit Drivers / Page 5) - section dated July 2024 serves as the primary valuation narrative for a May 2025 report.",
        "The Analyst Note (May 2025) forecasts a 7% 5-year CAGR, while the Financials table (Page 15) calculates a 6.8% 5-year CAGR."
