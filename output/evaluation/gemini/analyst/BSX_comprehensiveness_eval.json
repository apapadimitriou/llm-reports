    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, covering all required sections from the executive summary to detailed ESG and capital allocation analysis. It provides strong sector-specific context for a medical device company, focusing on key product franchises like Farapulse and Watchman as the primary value drivers. The valuation section explicitly links the fair value estimate (FVE) increase from $84 to $93 to specific operational improvements in the electrophysiology segment and the impact of tariffs on margins. The financials snapshot is robust, providing a multi-year history and five-year forecasts for essential metrics including revenue growth, operating margins, and ROIC. Peer benchmarking is effectively integrated through a competitor comparison table on page 3 and an ESG peer analysis on page 15. The report avoids significant redundancy, as the repetition of key themes in the Analyst Note serves as a proper executive summary for the deeper dives in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section. The primary gap preventing an 'Excellent' grade is the absence of a quantitative scenario or sensitivity analysis table (e.g., a bull/bear valuation bridge or a table showing FVE sensitivity to WACC or organic growth rates). While qualitative bull and bear cases are present, they are not mathematically linked to alternative valuation outcomes.",
