    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to a critical internal contradiction regarding the cost of capital and a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. In the 'Economic Moat' section, the author cites a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 5.9% to argue for a wide moat based on excess returns. However, the 'Appendix' lists the discount rate as 8.2%. This 230-basis-point discrepancy is an unresolved numeric contradiction that fundamentally undermines the valuation's credibility. Per the grading instructions, one contradiction combined with a lack of quantified sensitivities triggers a 'Poor' rating.\n\nWhile the report identifies material drivers\u2014such as the $3 billion revenue headwind from Stelara biosimilars and a 4.5% long-term revenue CAGR\u2014it fails to stress-test these inputs. The 'Risk & Uncertainty' section is purely qualitative, offering no quantified ranges or scenarios (e.g., Bull/Bear cases) to show how variations in drug pricing or litigation outcomes would impact the $164 fair value estimate. Justification for assumptions is weak, relying heavily on management's own guidance rather than independent historical or peer benchmarking. Specificity is also lacking; for example, the 'modest share count reduction' is never quantified, and the 100-150 bps margin expansion is presented as a broad range without a clear causal bridge or year-by-year trajectory. These flaws result in a 'black-box' model that lacks the auditability required for a higher grade.",
