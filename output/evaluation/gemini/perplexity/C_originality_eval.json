    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a comprehensive summary of provided search results rather than an original piece of equity research. Every key insight\u2014including the organizational restructuring details (reduction from 13 to 8 layers), specific regulatory fine amounts ($135.6M), and the Services segment's decade-high performance\u2014is a direct restatement of the provided sources (Sources 17, 21, and 19 respectively). The valuation section adopts a Fair Value estimate ($135.54) directly from Source 15 without introducing any novel drivers, sensitivity analysis, or independent modeling adjustments. There is no evidence of synthesis where disparate data points (e.g., linking specific deposit beta trajectories to the 2026 ROE target) are combined to form a new, testable conclusion. The 'Economic Moat' and 'Bulls/Bears' sections utilize boilerplate industry language ('global footprint,' 'switching costs') that is generic to the banking sector and lacks company-specific interpretive depth. Because the report lacks any original thesis or synthesis and relies entirely on paraphrasing cited sources, it fails the fundamental requirement for originality.",
