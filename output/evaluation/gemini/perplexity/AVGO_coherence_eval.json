    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of structural organization and professional tone, yet it is undermined by significant internal contradictions and temporal inconsistencies that trigger mandatory grading caps. Most notably, there is a mathematical disconnect regarding growth projections: the Fair Value section cites a revenue CAGR of 21.4% from fiscal 2024 to 2027, while the Appendix explicitly lists a 28% CAGR for the same period. Furthermore, the Financials Snapshot table shows revenue growing from $51.6B to $110.0B, which calculates to a 28.7% CAGR, leaving the narrative's 21.4% figure entirely unsupported. Temporal alignment is also flawed. The report is dated June 26, 2025, yet the Cover Block and Source 8 cite a 'Last close' price from August 8, 2025. This 'future-dated' pricing relative to the report's issuance creates a logical impossibility. Additionally, the dividend yield of 0.92% stated in the Capital Allocation section is mathematically inconsistent with the provided $0.58 quarterly dividend and the $304.97 stock price, which results in a 0.76% yield. While the narrative flow between the semiconductor and software segments is smooth and the Bulls/Bears arguments are well-integrated into the valuation logic, these quantitative and temporal errors necessitate a 'fair' grade under the rubric's guardrails.",
