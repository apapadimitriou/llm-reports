    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of professional clarity and structural organization, effectively mapping the company's transition from hardware-centric growth to a services-oriented model. The language is precise, and the Analyst Note provides a cohesive summary that links the Q2 2025 financial results to broader strategic headwinds like China competition and AI delays. However, the document fails to achieve a higher grade due to significant internal tensions and formatting issues. Specifically, the Bulls Say section posits an 'AI-driven upgrade cycle,' yet the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section explicitly models 'modest annual declines' for the iPhone segment without explaining why the bullish catalyst is excluded from the base case. This lack of reconciliation between the optimistic scenarios and the valuation model creates a disconnect for the reader. Furthermore, the report triggers an auto-downgrade because multiple sections\u2014specifically Bulls Say / Bears Say and the Appendix\u2014are presented as 'bullet dumps' rather than integrated narrative prose. While the temporal claims are accurate and the financial table aligns with the narrative's margin assumptions (e.g., 31.03% Q2 margin vs. 30.8% FY25E), these structural and logical gaps necessitate a fair grade. The reader is left to bridge the gap between the qualitative opportunities and the quantitative model.",
