    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of structural coherence and narrative flow, particularly in how it weaves the $4 billion technology investment theme through the Analyst Note, Strategy, and Capital Allocation sections. The language is professional, and the transition from the 'Responsible Growth' philosophy to specific segment performance is logical. However, the report fails on temporal accuracy and internal numerical consistency, triggering a 'fair' hard cap. Specifically, the report is dated July 2, 2025, yet it cites Q2 2025 earnings results (EPS of $0.89) that would not have been released until mid-July. This chronological impossibility undermines the reliability of the 'recent' claims. Additionally, there is a significant unresolved tension between the narrative and the Financials Snapshot: the Analyst Note cites Q1 2025 revenue of $27.4 billion and predicts 6-7% annual growth, which would imply a full-year revenue exceeding $110 billion. Conversely, the Financials Snapshot table estimates FY 2025 revenue at only $105.2 billion. This discrepancy suggests a revenue decline in the latter half of the year that contradicts the 'steady growth' narrative. While the economic moat and risk sections are well-integrated, these fundamental data misalignments necessitate a downgrade.",
