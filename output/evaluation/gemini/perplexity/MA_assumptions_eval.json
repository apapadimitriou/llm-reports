    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s quality of assumptions is graded as Poor due to multiple internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is explicit in listing its key drivers\u2014such as WACC (8.5%), terminal growth (3.0%), and revenue CAGRs (11.2%)\u2014and provides specific units and time horizons, it fails the consistency and stress-testing pillars. Specifically, two distinct numeric contradictions exist between the narrative and the financial tables. First, the narrative claims 'Earnings per share growth of 15\u201318% annually through 2027,' yet the report\u2019s own financial snapshot models 2025 EPS growth at only 8.8% and a three-year CAGR (2024\u20132027) of 13.6%. Second, the text sets a 'Target operating margin in the high-50% range,' while the accompanying table and appendix explicitly forecast margins starting at 60.1% and rising to 61.7%. Furthermore, the report fails the stress-testing requirement. Although it identifies 'Key valuation sensitivities' like payment volumes and regulatory impacts, it offers no quantified ranges, bull/bear scenarios, or sensitivity tables showing the impact of these variables on the $640 fair value estimate. Per the grading rubric, the combination of multiple internal contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade, as the outputs function as a 'black box' that does not reconcile with the stated narrative logic.",
