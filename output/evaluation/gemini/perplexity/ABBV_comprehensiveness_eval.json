    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is fundamentally incomplete and fails to meet the basic structural requirements for equity research. Most critically, it entirely omits the 'Financials Snapshot' section; there is no multi-year historical or forecasted data table, which is a core requirement. Furthermore, the report terminates abruptly mid-sentence in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section, leaving the valuation analysis unfinished. While the text mentions specific drug revenues (Skyrizi, Rinvoq), it lacks structured sector-specific KPIs such as a clinical pipeline status table, trial dates, or a patent expiration schedule. Although in-text citations are present (e.g., [6], [14]), the 'Sources' and 'Appendix' sections are missing entirely, making the evidence unverifiable. The absence of peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis further contributes to a lack of depth. Because the report is physically truncated and missing the mandatory financial exhibits, it is classified as Poor.",
