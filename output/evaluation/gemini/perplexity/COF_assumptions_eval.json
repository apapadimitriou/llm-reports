    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for several key drivers, including Net Interest Margin (7.0\u20137.3%), credit card revenue growth (3.1% CAGR), and charge-off rates (4.5\u20135.0%). These are primarily located in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section, ensuring they are proximal to the forecasts they inform. Justification is 'partial'; while the report cites historical performance and management targets (e.g., $1.2B in synergies), it lacks the multi-year historical data tables or peer benchmarking required for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating. Internal consistency is generally maintained, though the 81% revenue decline mentioned in the narrative for Q2 2025 creates a complex reconciliation with the massive annual revenue jump shown in the tables. Crucially, the report fails the 'Hard Cap' for a higher grade because it lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While it mentions risks qualitatively in the 'Risk & Uncertainty' section, it does not provide a range of valuation outcomes or EPS impacts based on fluctuations in material drivers like interest rates or credit losses. Additionally, while an all-stock merger is discussed, the specific share count assumption driving the EPS calculation is not explicitly stated. Consequently, the outputs feel somewhat 'black-box' despite the clear listing of several key inputs.",
