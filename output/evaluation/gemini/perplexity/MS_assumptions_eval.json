    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to a combination of significant internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly identifies key drivers such as revenue growth, operating margins, and WACC, these assumptions are weakly justified. There is no multi-year historical data or peer benchmarking provided to support the specific magnitudes chosen. A critical numeric contradiction exists between the narrative and the data tables: Section 8 ('Fair Value and Profit Drivers') explicitly assumes 'revenue growth of approximately 6-8% annually over the next five years,' yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table in Section 11 shows 2025E revenue growth of only 4.3% ($61.8B to $64.5B) and a three-year CAGR of approximately 5.1%. Per the instruction's hard caps, the presence of a distinct contradiction combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities (the 'Risk & Uncertainty' section is entirely qualitative) necessitates a 'Poor' grade. Furthermore, the valuation parameters\u2014specifically the 9.5% WACC and 3.0% terminal growth rate\u2014are presented as point estimates without any underlying calculation, source, or scenario testing, rendering the model's outputs a 'black box' that cannot be audited or stress-tested by the reader.",
