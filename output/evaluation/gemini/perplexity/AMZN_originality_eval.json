    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a comprehensive summary of public earnings data and management commentary rather than providing original insights. Every identified insight\u2014from the triple-digit AI growth run-rate to the fulfillment network efficiencies\u2014is a direct restatement of information provided in the cited sources (specifically sources [7], [12], and [15]). There is no evidence of the author synthesizing disparate data points to reach a conclusion not already explicitly stated by Amazon's management or public news. For example, the link between fulfillment modernization and margin expansion is presented as a fact from the earnings call rather than an original analytical synthesis. The valuation section relies on standard revenue CAGRs and a generic WACC without introducing a novel mechanism or driver. Because the report lacks any original thesis or synthesis beyond paraphrasing the provided sources, it fails to meet the minimum threshold for a 'Fair' grade under the established decision rules.",
