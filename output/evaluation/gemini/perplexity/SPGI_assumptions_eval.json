    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to the combination of internal numeric contradictions and a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists several key drivers\u2014such as a 5-year revenue CAGR, margin expansion, and WACC\u2014these figures fail to reconcile with the provided 'Financials Snapshot' table. Specifically, the narrative claims a revenue CAGR of '7-9%,' yet the table's data ($14.2B in 2024 to $19.9B in 2029) calculates to a 6.98% CAGR, which falls below the stated range. Additionally, the text cites a 2024 EPS of 'approximately $13.00,' while the table records $12.8. Per the 'Hard Caps' in the instructions, the presence of at least one contradiction combined with the lack of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade. Beyond consistency issues, the justifications for material inputs like the 8.5% WACC and 3.0% terminal growth rate are entirely opaque, provided as point estimates without supporting calculations, peer benchmarks, or historical context. The report relies on qualitative discussion of risks (e.g., interest rate pressure) but fails to provide any stress-testing or scenario-based valuation ranges (e.g., Bull/Bear cases), leaving the final Fair Value Estimate of $585 as a 'black-box' output. This lack of transparency and rigor in the assumption-to-conclusion pipeline prevents the report from meeting the standards for a higher grade.",
