    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally sound and covers all mandatory sections, including a detailed business description, strategy, and capital allocation analysis. However, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to two primary deficiencies that trigger hard caps. First, the Financials Snapshot utilizes generic corporate metrics (FCF, ROIC, Operating Margin) and omits essential banking-sector KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Net Interest Income (NII), and CET1 ratios from the multi-year forecast table. While some of these are mentioned in the text, their absence from the primary data snapshot violates the requirement for sector-appropriate financial reporting. Second, the valuation section lists operating drivers (NIM stabilization, efficiency targets) but lacks an explicit mathematical link or bridge showing how these drivers result in the $85.00 fair value estimate. Additionally, peer benchmarking is purely qualitative with no comparative data table, and the sensitivity analysis is mentioned only in passing without defined bull/bear scenarios. The report also contains a chronological contradiction, citing a 'Q2 2025' earnings report in March 2025, which undermines the reliability of the evidence integration.",
