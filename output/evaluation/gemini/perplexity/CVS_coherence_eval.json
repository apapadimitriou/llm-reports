    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report suffers from a fundamental temporal collapse. It is dated May 12, 2025, yet the Intro and Analyst Note repeatedly cite 'Q2 2025 performance' and specific revenue figures ($98.9 billion) as historical facts. Since the second quarter of 2025 would not conclude until June 30, these figures cannot exist as actuals at the time of writing. This creates a massive internal contradiction: the Analyst Note treats these as realized results, while the Financials Snapshot table correctly labels 2025 figures as '2025E' (estimates). Furthermore, the citations are logically disconnected; Source 3 is dated 2018 but is used to support 2025 revenue data, and Source 8 is dated February 2025 but claims to analyze Q2 2025 results. The Bulls and Bears sections are essentially bulleted lists formatted as paragraphs, failing the transition requirement. There is no meaningful reconciliation between the Bear case regarding retail viability and the Base Case valuation, which simply assumes margin expansion from store closures without addressing the underlying competitive threats mentioned in the Bears section. The use of 'recent' and 'now' is fundamentally flawed given the impossible dates. These issues require a 'poor' grade under the rubric's strict guidelines regarding contradictions and temporal accuracy.",
