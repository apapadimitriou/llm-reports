    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is entirely derivative, functioning as a high-quality summary of public news and company press releases rather than an original piece of equity research. It identifies five key areas\u2014the Mobility segment spinoff, the IHS Markit integration, the leadership transition to Martina Cheung, the 'wide moat' from the S&P 500 index, and secular growth in ESG\u2014but each is a restatement of well-known public facts or management's own narrative. There is zero evidence of synthesis; the author does not link disparate data points to form new conclusions (e.g., quantifying the specific margin impact of the Mobility spinoff's stranded costs). The valuation section is boilerplate, using standard growth rates (7\u20139%) and a generic terminal growth rate without identifying a novel driver or specific catalyst. Because the report lacks any original thesis or interpretive commentary that goes beyond paraphrasing sources, it fails the primary requirement for originality.",
