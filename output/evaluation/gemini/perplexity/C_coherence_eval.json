    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded poor due to significant internal contradictions and severe temporal inaccuracies that undermine the credibility of the analysis. The most glaring issue is the mathematical impossibility presented in the Analyst Note and Financials Snapshot: the report claims Q2 2025 net income reached $8.1 billion with an EPS of $1.96, yet implies Q1 2025 had $4.1 billion in net income with the exact same $1.96 EPS. This would require a doubling of the share count in a single quarter, which is not addressed and directly contradicts the mentioned $20 billion share repurchase program. Furthermore, the report suffers from major chronological failures. It cites a 'Q2 2025 Earnings Report' (Source 1) dated March 19, 2025, which is impossible as the second quarter of 2025 does not end until June 30. Similarly, it describes fines in 2025 as 'recent' while citing a source from July 2024 (Source 16). While the narrative flow between sections like Business Strategy and Economic Moat is superficially smooth, the underlying data is fundamentally disconnected. The Bulls/Bears sections are presented as isolated lists and are not reconciled with the Fair Value Estimate, which sits 46% above the current price despite 'High' uncertainty and 'medium-high' ESG risk. These unresolved tensions and factual misalignments require the reader to reconstruct the argument, failing the basic requirements for a coherent research report.",
