    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a high-quality summary of existing public information and management commentary but fails to provide any original synthesis or unique theses. Every core insight is a restatement of public financial results (Q4 FY2025 revenue, NRR), news headlines (Cortex AI launch, NVIDIA/Anthropic partnerships), or generic market tropes ('picks and shovels' play, 'Standard Oil' analogy). The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' and 'Economic Moat' sections utilize boilerplate SaaS industry language regarding switching costs and network effects without company-specific nuances that aren't already in public filings. Crucially, the valuation section lacks any novel driver, relying instead on standard management guidance for gross margins (75%) and generic CAGR assumptions. There is no evidence of the author linking disparate data points to form a new conclusion; for example, the report mentions AI adoption but does not quantify how specific product launches will mathematically alter the NII or ROE trajectory beyond what is already priced in. Per the decision rules, the absence of at least one synthesis or original thesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
