    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits 'Good' analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to establish clear causal links between regulatory developments and financial outcomes. Specifically, it identifies the 'asset cap removal' as the primary mechanism for 'renewed growth' and 'expanded balance sheet capacity.' It provides a robust set of explicit assumptions, including a 'Terminal Growth Rate: 2.5%' and a 'Discount Rate: 10.5%,' which are benchmarked against industry peers (e.g., 'highest projected increase among major banks'). The report uses significant quantification, such as the '16% CRE concentration' and the 'efficiency ratio improvement toward 65%.' However, it falls short of 'Excellent' because it lacks a formal, quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While it mentions a 'fair value range of $78-92 per share,' it does not provide the underlying math or specific 'what-if' scenarios (e.g., quantifying the exact impact of a 50bps rate cut on NIM or a specific increase in CRE charge-offs on EPS). The implications are actionable, clearly stating a 'Price/FVE: 0.92' and detailing capital allocation plans, but the exploration of uncertainty is primarily qualitative rather than stress-tested through quantified modeling.",
