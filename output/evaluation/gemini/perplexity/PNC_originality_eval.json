    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique theses, functioning instead as a high-quality summary of existing public data and cited sources. Every 'insight' identified is a restatement of factual information available in the company's investor relations materials or the provided source list. For example, the $1.5 billion branch expansion plan, the 0.33% net charge-off rate, and the $30 billion ESG commitment are all direct restatements of public disclosures. There is no attempt to link these data points\u2014such as analyzing how the branch expansion specifically impacts deposit betas or how the PINACLE platform's integration affects fee-income margins relative to peers. The valuation section is entirely generic, relying on consensus growth rates (3-4%) and standard P/E multiples without introducing a novel driver or mechanism. Per the decision rules, the absence of any synthesis or original thesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
