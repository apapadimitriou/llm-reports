    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive financial reporting to explain the causal mechanisms of AbbVie\u2019s post-Humira transition. It identifies the \"favorable mix shift toward higher-margin biologics\" as a primary driver for projected margin expansion to 45\u201347%. The report provides explicit, quantified forecasts, such as the \"outlook for Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed $31 billion\" by 2027, which serves as a clear anchor for the valuation. Inference quality is high, as it ties the fair value estimate of $215 to specific drivers like a \"7\u20138% CAGR\" and a \"WACC of 7.5% reflects AbbVie's strong credit profile.\" Furthermore, it benchmarks assumptions, noting that the \"terminal growth rate... aligns with long-term pharmaceutical industry expectations.\" However, the report falls short of an \"Excellent\" grade because it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or multi-scenario modeling. While it qualitatively identifies that \"Key sensitivity factors include Skyrizi and Rinvoq adoption rates,\" it does not provide numerical ranges or \"if-then\" impacts on the fair value or EPS. The implications are actionable and decision-relevant, but the lack of stress-testing against the $31 billion sales assumption limits the depth of the uncertainty analysis.",
