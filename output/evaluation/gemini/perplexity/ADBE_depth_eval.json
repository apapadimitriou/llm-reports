    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits high analytical depth by providing a clear causal framework for Adobe\u2019s growth and profitability. It moves beyond simple description, utilizing the \"monetization architecture described... as 'P times Q plus V'\" to explain how AI integration drives revenue. The analysis is well-quantified, citing a \"42% market share in creative software\" and specific subscriber growth targets of \"1 million net additions per quarter.\" Assumptions are explicit, including a \"WACC assumption of 8.5%\" and a \"terminal growth rate 3.5%.\" The report addresses uncertainty through a detailed \"Risk & Uncertainty\" section and a quantified scenario table in the appendix that outlines \"Base,\" \"Bull,\" and \"Bear\" cases for key drivers like \"Revenue CAGR\" and \"AI Revenue Contribution.\" Actionable implications are clearly stated with a \"Fair-Value Estimate: $475.00\" compared to the \"Last Close: $341.05.\" While the report benchmarks performance against \"consensus estimates by 2.02%,\" it lacks explicit benchmarking for its terminal growth assumption against long-term GDP or industry norms. Nevertheless, the combination of mechanism-rich reasoning and quantified multi-scenario analysis meets the criteria for an Excellent grade.",
