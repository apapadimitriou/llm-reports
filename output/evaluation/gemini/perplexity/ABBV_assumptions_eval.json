    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit point-estimate assumptions for several material drivers, including a revenue CAGR of 7-8% through 2029, operating margins of 45-47%, and a specific WACC of 7.5%. These are proximal to the valuation conclusion and include specific units and time horizons. Justification is partial; while the report cites management guidance for product sales and industry expectations for terminal growth, it lacks a detailed build-up for the WACC or a multi-year historical comparison to validate the margin expansion claims. The report's primary deficiency is the total absence of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While it qualitatively lists 'key sensitivity factors' such as adoption rates and competitive dynamics, it fails to provide quantified ranges or impact analysis on the Fair Value Estimate (FVE). Per the instruction's hard caps, the lack of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers mandates a maximum grade of 'Fair'. Internal consistency is maintained between the stated EPS growth and revenue targets, and no numeric contradictions were identified.",
