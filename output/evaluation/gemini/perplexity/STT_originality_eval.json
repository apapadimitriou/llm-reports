    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is almost entirely a retrospective summary of historical earnings releases (Q4 2024 and Q1 2025) and public company descriptions. It fails to provide any original synthesis or a non-obvious thesis. The 'Analyst Note' merely recaps EPS beats and revenue figures already available in public filings. The discussion of the 'State Street Alpha' platform and the 'Beacon' program uses boilerplate corporate language that has been standard for the company for several years, offering no new interpretive commentary or company-specific angles. Furthermore, the valuation section is generic, utilizing standard growth assumptions (4-6% fee growth) without identifying novel drivers or specific catalysts. Because the report lacks any clear synthesis of data points into new conclusions and relies on generic sector trends (e.g., 'secular shift to passive investing'), it fails the minimum requirements for a 'Fair' grade under the provided decision rules.",
