    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report achieves a 'Good' grade by providing clear causal mechanisms and explicit, quantified assumptions. It explains why margins are expected to improve, citing 'fulfillment network modernization' and 'direct lanes' that are 'reducing per-unit fulfillment costs.' The analysis is grounded in data, providing a full financial snapshot and explicit valuation drivers such as a 'WACC of 9.5%' and a 'terminal growth rate: 3.0%.' Benchmarking is utilized to provide context, specifically noting that the 'P/E ratio has compressed from 90... to approximately 30,' which helps justify the valuation. The report also links AWS's future performance to its 'multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate' in AI. However, it fails to reach 'Excellent' because it lacks quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While it identifies significant risks, such as the 'FTC's comprehensive antitrust lawsuit,' it does not model how different legal outcomes would specifically alter the 'Fair-Value Estimate $261.18.' Similarly, while it notes that the 'low-end [of guidance] significantly below consensus estimates,' it does not provide a bear-case valuation range based on this uncertainty. The implications are actionable (Price/FVE of 0.85), but the lack of 'if-then' quantification for key risks limits the analytical depth.",
