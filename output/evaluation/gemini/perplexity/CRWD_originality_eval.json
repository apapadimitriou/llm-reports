    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique theses, functioning instead as a high-quality summary of the provided search results. Every 'insight' identified is a direct restatement of data points found in the source material, particularly regarding Q1 2026 EPS beats, ARR growth percentages, and Charlotte AI deal counts (sourced directly from [3], [11], and [14]). There is no attempt to link disparate data points\u2014such as connecting the specific financial impact of the July 2024 outage to a quantified shift in customer acquisition costs or competitive win rates. The valuation section is entirely generic, utilizing standard CAGR and WACC assumptions without identifying a novel driver or company-specific mechanism. The 'Economic Moat' and 'Business Strategy' sections rely on boilerplate industry phrasing ('land and expand,' 'switching costs') that could apply to almost any SaaS provider. Because the report contains zero syntheses or original theses and relies on at least six copied or generic restatements, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the established decision rules.",
