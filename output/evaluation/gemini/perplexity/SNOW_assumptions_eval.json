    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to multiple internal numeric contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers. First, the narrative explicitly assumes a 22% revenue CAGR through FY2029, yet the provided Financials Snapshot table (projecting revenue from $3,483M to $8,726M) calculates to a CAGR of only 20.1%. Second, the narrative cites a trailing twelve-month (TTM) EPS of negative $4.21, which conflicts significantly with the Financials Snapshot table showing FY2024 EPS at ($3.42) and FY2025E at ($0.85). While the report identifies key drivers\u2014including WACC (10.5%), terminal growth (3.0%), and customer acquisition targets\u2014it fails to provide any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for these inputs. The mention of a fair value range ($175\u2013$235) is an output-only statement that lacks transparency regarding how specific changes in drivers (like NRR or operating margins) impact the valuation. Justifications for these assumptions are largely qualitative or attributed to 'management guidance' without historical or peer-based benchmarking. These unresolved contradictions and the 'black-box' nature of the valuation range violate the core requirements for internal consistency and stress-testing, triggering the 'Poor' grade under the defined hard caps.",
