    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a professional structure and clear prose, but it is fundamentally undermined by severe temporal contradictions and source misalignments. The most glaring issue is the disconnect between the narrative and the financial data. The Analyst Note and Business Strategy sections discuss Q1 2026 results and the July 2024 outage, yet the Financials Snapshot table lists FY 2025 as 'Estimated' (E). In a standard fiscal calendar, if Q1 2026 results are available, FY 2025 must be finalized as 'Actual' (A). This creates a logical break in the report's timeline.\n\nFurthermore, the report relies on dangerously outdated sources to support 'current' valuation metrics. It cites a 2021 source [8] for the company's $105.8B market capitalization and a 2022 source [13] for current analyst price targets. Using three-year-old data for highly volatile market metrics in a report dated June 2025 is a failure of basic research integrity. Similarly, the ESG section relies on a 2021 source [15], ignoring nearly four years of subsequent developments. While the narrative flow is smooth and the 'Bulls/Bears' are well-articulated, the underlying data is a patchwork of chronologically inconsistent facts. The reader cannot trust the 'Fair Value' or 'Financials' sections when the foundational citations are years out of date. This necessitates a 'poor' grade as the internal contradictions and temporal inaccuracies require the reader to reconstruct the actual current state of the company.",
