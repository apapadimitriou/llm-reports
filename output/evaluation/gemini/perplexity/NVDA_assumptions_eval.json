    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions assessment due to multiple severe internal contradictions and a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key drivers such as revenue growth, margins, and WACC, these figures are not internally coherent. For instance, the narrative forecasts annual revenue growth of 25\u201330% through FY27, yet the provided financial table calculates to only 20% growth for that year ($210B vs $175B). More critically, the text targets margins of 72\u201375%, while the 'Financials Snapshot' table lists operating margins significantly lower, ranging from 55\u201359%, with no reconciliation between gross and operating figures. The historical data in the table is also factually erroneous and contradicts the report's own narrative; it lists FY23 revenue at $60.9B and FY24 at $22.1B (a 63% decline), which conflicts with the stated 'exceptional growth trajectory' and actual market history. Furthermore, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis, failing to provide ranges for material drivers like AI chip demand or the impact of China export restrictions. These unresolved numeric conflicts between the text and tables, combined with the lack of stress-testing, trigger the 'Poor' grade under the mandatory hard caps.",
