    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to multiple significant internal contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers, triggering several hard caps. While the report explicitly lists key inputs such as WACC (9.5%), terminal growth (3.0%), and tax rates (21%) in the Appendix, these figures lack any supporting justification or evidence-rich benchmarking.\n\nA primary contradiction exists between the narrative and the financial tables: the text forecasts revenue growth 'moderating to 12-15% annually,' yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table models a jump from $9.2B in FY2025E to $10.8B in FY2026E, representing a 17.4% growth rate. Furthermore, the report claims a '2% annual share count decline' through repurchases while simultaneously highlighting a $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk. Given the company\u2019s $111.6 billion market cap and limited $2.4 billion cash balance, executing a deal of this magnitude would almost certainly require massive equity issuance or debt, making a simultaneous 2% share reduction financially incoherent.\n\nFinally, the report fails the sensitivity requirement. Although it provides 'Bull' and 'Bear' price targets ($250 and $150), it does not quantify the specific ranges for the underlying drivers (e.g., revenue growth or margin levels) that lead to these valuations. The scenarios remain qualitative descriptions rather than auditable stress tests. Per the evaluation rules, the combination of numeric contradictions and the absence of quantified driver sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
