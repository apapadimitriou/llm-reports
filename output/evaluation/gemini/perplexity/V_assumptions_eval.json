    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a high degree of explicitness and specificity regarding its core assumptions. Key drivers such as revenue growth (segmented by consumer and commercial flows), operating margins, WACC, and terminal growth are clearly stated and proximal to the valuation narrative. The internal consistency is excellent; the figures cited in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section reconcile perfectly with the 'Financials Snapshot' table and the 'Appendix.' For instance, the projected 9\u201312% revenue CAGR is mathematically supported by the table's progression from $35.9B in FY24 to $47.1B in FY27. Justification is solid, grounding margin expansion in 'operating leverage' and the shift toward higher-margin value-added services. However, the report fails the 'Stress-tested' requirement. While it provides a final Fair Value range ($350\u2013$420), it does not provide quantified sensitivity analysis for the material drivers themselves. There are no 'what-if' scenarios or tables demonstrating how a 1% change in WACC or a deviation in cross-border volume would specifically impact the EPS or valuation. Per the instruction's hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivity on material drivers\u2014relying instead on a qualitative mention of 'macroeconomic conditions'\u2014limits the maximum possible grade to 'Fair.'",
