    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly explicit and internally consistent. Key drivers such as Revenue CAGR (4.8%), NII growth (1-3%), and the Efficiency Ratio (targeting 65%) are clearly stated and reconcile perfectly with the provided financial snapshot table. Justification is solid, leveraging management guidance, historical expense saving tracks ($12B), and peer/analyst benchmarks (Goldman Sachs). Specificity is high, with clear units and time horizons (e.g., 2025-2029). However, the report fails to provide robust, quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers. While it offers a Fair Value range ($78-92) and a WACC range (10-11%), it lacks the 'if-then' quantification for operational levers like Net Interest Margin (NIM) or Credit Loss rates. There is no scenario analysis (e.g., Bear/Base/Bull) detailing how specific changes in macroeconomic conditions or CRE loss magnitudes would impact the valuation. Additionally, while share buybacks are mentioned ($40B), the specific projected share count used in the EPS calculation is not disclosed. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis on material drivers caps the grade at 'Fair.'",
