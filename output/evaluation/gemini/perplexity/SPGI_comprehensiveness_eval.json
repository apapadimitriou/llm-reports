    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report successfully populates all required structural sections and maintains consistent in-text citations. However, it fails to meet the criteria for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade due to significant gaps in sector-specific depth and quantitative modeling. The Financials Snapshot is generic, providing only high-level metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF) while omitting critical sector KPIs such as Assets Under Management (AUM) for the Indices segment, debt issuance volumes for the Ratings segment, and retention rates for Market Intelligence. Per the instruction's hard caps, the omission of \u22652 core sector KPIs limits the grade to 'Fair.' Additionally, the valuation section is primarily descriptive; it lacks an explicit quantitative bridge or sensitivity table linking operating drivers to the fair value outcome. The total absence of peer benchmarking (e.g., comparisons to Moody's or MSCI) further necessitates a downgrade. While the report is well-organized, it functions more as a summary than a comprehensive equity research piece with the required analytical depth.",
