    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete, covering all required sections from the Analyst Note to ESG. However, it fails to meet the depth requirements for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to significant omissions in the Financials Snapshot and the lack of comparative context. Specifically, the Financials Snapshot table is generic, omitting core sector-specific KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Net Charge-off (NCO) rates, and the CET1 ratio in the forecast grid. While some of these figures are mentioned qualitatively or as single-point assumptions in the text, their absence from the multi-year financial summary violates the requirement for sector-appropriate KPI integration. Furthermore, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking section and quantitative scenario/sensitivity analysis (e.g., a table showing how a 100bps increase in unemployment affects the Fair Value Estimate). These gaps, combined with the hard cap on missing sector KPIs in the financials block, result in a 'Fair' grade.",
