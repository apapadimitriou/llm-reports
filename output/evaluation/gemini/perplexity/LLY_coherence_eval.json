    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a critical failure in temporal and logical coherence, primarily driven by a future-dating paradox. While the document is officially dated June 7, 2025, the narrative frequently cites data from August 2025, including market capitalization figures and specific Q2 2025 earnings results. Because Q2 ends on June 30, a report authored on June 7 cannot factually present finalized quarterly revenue of $15.56 billion as delivered results. This creates an irreconcilable contradiction that undermines the report's credibility. Furthermore, the Financials Snapshot table lists 2025 as an estimate (2025E), directly contradicting the Analyst Note which discusses 2025 figures as historical actual data. The transition between the narrative's aggressive growth claims and the Bulls/Bears section is also poorly handled; the bearish concerns regarding high valuation multiples are never reconciled with the report's own Fair Value Estimate of $900, which implies the stock is currently a deep value play at 0.69x Price/FVE. Finally, the Bulls/Bears section lacks connective tissue, reading as a list of isolated points rather than a synthesized argument. These multiple unaddressed contradictions and temporal inaccuracies trigger mandatory downgrades under the grading rubric, resulting in a final grade of poor.",
