    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a high-quality summary of Visa's public disclosures and management narrative but lacks any original synthesis or unique thesis. It relies almost exclusively on restating Q2 FY2025 earnings results and management's own strategic frameworks, such as the 'Network of Networks' and the 'Three Engines' of growth. Every 'insight' provided\u2014from the 18% growth in value-added services to the 16-18% growth target for commercial payments\u2014is a direct paraphrase of company filings or investor day presentations. There is no evidence of the analyst combining disparate data points to reach a non-obvious conclusion or presenting a testable, company-specific thesis with a unique catalyst. The valuation section is entirely generic, utilizing standard consensus-aligned growth rates and margins without introducing a novel driver or mechanism. Per the decision rules, the total absence of synthesis or an original thesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
