    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is a professional and well-structured synthesis of existing data, but it fails to reach the 'Good' threshold due to a heavy reliance on restating specific figures and narratives from the provided sources. At least four key insights are direct restatements or generic industry observations: the quantification of China tariff impacts ($400M revenue/$375M income) is pulled directly from source [14], the valuation multiple comparison (18x vs. 22x) is taken from source [4], the market share data is from source [6], and the explanation of the economic moat (FDA revalidation/switching costs) is standard industry boilerplate. While the report offers two clear syntheses\u2014specifically linking the $2B U.S. manufacturing investment to geopolitical risk mitigation and reshoring trends, and connecting the $130B-$180B biopharma R&D spend trajectory to the company's organic growth targets\u2014these are overshadowed by the volume of restated content. Per the grading instructions, the presence of three or more restated or generic insights triggers a hard cap at the 'Fair' grade. Furthermore, the valuation section lacks a novel driver, relying on standard P/E normalization and macro-driven revenue growth.",
