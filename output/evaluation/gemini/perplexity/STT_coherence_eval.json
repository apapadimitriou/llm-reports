    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report suffers from a fundamental temporal paradox and significant citation misalignment. The report is dated June 29, 2025, yet the opening paragraph and Analyst Note discuss Q2 2025 earnings results ($2.53 EPS) as already 'delivered.' Since the second quarter of 2025 does not end until June 30, and earnings are typically reported in mid-July, it is impossible for these figures to be finalized or cited as historical facts on the report date. This creates a massive internal contradiction between the narrative and the calendar. Furthermore, the citations provided in the 'Sources' section are frequently misaligned with the 2025 data they supposedly support. For instance, Source [7] is dated August 2, 2021, yet it is used to justify specific 2025 earnings beats. Similarly, Source [14] from 2022 is used to support 2025 dividend payout ratios. These 'future-dated' claims backed by years-old sources undermine the entire credibility of the analysis. While the structural flow between sections like the Analyst Note and Strategy is superficially smooth, the underlying data integrity is non-existent. The reader is forced to reconcile how 2021-2022 sources could possibly validate 2025 performance metrics, leading to a failure in coherence.",
