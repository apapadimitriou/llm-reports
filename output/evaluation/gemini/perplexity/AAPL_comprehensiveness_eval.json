    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required structural sections and maintains consistent sourcing throughout. However, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to significant omissions in the Financials Snapshot and the lack of comparative analysis. Specifically, the Financials Snapshot is generic, providing only high-level metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF) while omitting critical sector-specific KPIs such as segment-level revenue forecasts (iPhone vs. Services) and Installed Base growth\u2014metrics essential for a technology/consumer electronics firm. While these are mentioned in the text, their absence from the multi-year forecast table violates the requirement for sector-appropriate KPI integration in the financials. Furthermore, the report lacks a formal peer benchmarking table and a scenario/sensitivity analysis (e.g., Bull/Bear cases or WACC sensitivity), which are prerequisites for higher grades. Redundancy is also noted, as the $100B buyback and China regulatory risks are repeated across the Analyst Note, Bulls/Bears, and Risk sections with minimal incremental depth, triggering a downgrade per the instruction rules.",
