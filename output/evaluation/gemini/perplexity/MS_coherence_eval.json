    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates high structural coherence and professional polish. The narrative arc is logical, moving from a strong Q1 2025 performance summary to a detailed breakdown of business segments and valuation drivers. Transitions are seamless, particularly the connection between the 'exceptional' Q1 results and the moderated full-year projections in the Financials Snapshot. The report successfully reconciles the 'Bulls Say' emphasis on fee-based stability with the 'Bears Say' concern regarding capital markets volatility by highlighting the integrated business model's role in smoothing earnings. Terminology like CET1 ratios and ROIC is used consistently across the Analyst Note, Capital Allocation, and Financials sections.\n\nHowever, the report suffers from a significant temporal inaccuracy that triggers a mandatory downgrade to 'fair' under the guardrails. While the report is dated June 29, 2025, the bibliography includes multiple citations from August 2025 (Sources 5 and 10). This anachronism undermines the credibility of the document as a real-time research note, as it cites sources that would not exist for another two months relative to the report's own date. Additionally, Source 13 is dated 2018, which is far too old to support a 'current' target price consensus in a 2025 report. Despite these citation errors, the internal logic between the narrative and the data tables is perfectly aligned, with the Price/FVE calculation and the EPS progression showing meticulous attention to detail.",
