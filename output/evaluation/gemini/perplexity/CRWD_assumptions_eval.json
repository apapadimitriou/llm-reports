    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for its primary valuation drivers, including revenue CAGR, terminal operating margins, and WACC. These are clearly presented in both the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and a dedicated Appendix. Justification is solid, utilizing a mix of the company's historical performance (22% ARR growth) and industry-wide benchmarks (12.6% cybersecurity market CAGR). The report also includes a robust, quantified sensitivity analysis through a Base/Bull/Bear scenario table that links specific input changes to Fair Value outcomes. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to a significant unresolved numeric contradiction regarding earnings. The narrative claims a Q1 2026 EPS of $0.73 (described as a 'beat'), yet the Financials Snapshot table projects the full-year FY2026E EPS at only $1.45. This implies that the first quarter alone accounts for over 50% of the annual total, which fundamentally contradicts the report's narrative of steady growth and margin expansion, especially given the FY2025E estimate of $0.85. Additionally, while share buybacks are mentioned as a driver, the specific magnitude or share count assumptions remain opaque.",
