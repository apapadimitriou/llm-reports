    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a comprehensive summary of public information rather than a piece of original equity research. It fails to provide any unique synthesis or original thesis, relying entirely on paraphrasing management guidance and public news headlines. Key 'insights'\u2014such as the $1.5\u20132.5 billion revenue guidance, the $1.4\u20131.7 billion cost-reduction target, and the 48% market share figure\u2014are direct restatements of company filings and press releases. The narrative regarding the 'transition beyond COVID-19' is the standard consensus view and lacks a non-obvious or decision-relevant angle. Furthermore, the valuation section is boilerplate, utilizing standard DCF assumptions (11.5% WACC, 3% terminal growth) without introducing a novel driver or mechanism. There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points (e.g., manufacturing footprint changes to specific unit-cost trajectories vs. peers) to form a new conclusion. Per the decision rules, the absence of any synthesis or original thesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
