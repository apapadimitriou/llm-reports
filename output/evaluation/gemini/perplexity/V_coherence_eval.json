    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a professional structure with a clear narrative arc, transitioning effectively from high-level analyst notes to detailed segment analysis. However, it fails the coherence test due to internal mathematical contradictions and severe temporal misalignments in its supporting evidence. In the Capital Allocation section, the text states $5.6 billion was returned to shareholders, but the provided breakdown of $4.5 billion in buybacks and $1.2 billion in dividends totals $5.7 billion. Additionally, there is a significant, unexplained discrepancy between the narrative's claim of a 61% operating margin for Q2 FY2025 and the Financials Snapshot table, which projects a 66.5% margin for the full year 2025 despite a 67.1% margin in 2024. The most damaging issue is the reliance on outdated citations for current 2025 data. The report cites sources from 2016 (Source 5), 2018 (Source 9), and 2019 (Source 11) to justify 2025 market capitalization and P/E ratios. Using a nine-year-old source for a volatile metric like market cap in a 2025 report is a major temporal inaccuracy. While the qualitative sections on the 'Network of Networks' strategy and the economic moat are well-written and logically connected to the valuation narrative, these quantitative and evidentiary failures trigger the 'fair' grade cap.",
