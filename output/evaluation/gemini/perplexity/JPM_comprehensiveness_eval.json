    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows the required structural framework and includes all necessary thematic sections. However, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to significant omissions in sector-specific technical depth. Most notably, the Financials Snapshot table is generic and utilizes metrics (such as Free Cash Flow and ROIC) that are non-standard for the banking sector, while omitting critical banking KPIs like Net Interest Margin (NIM), Loan Loss Provisions, and the Efficiency Ratio in the multi-year forecast. Per the grading instructions, the absence of \u22652 core sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot triggers a hard cap at 'Fair'. Additionally, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking section or table, providing only vague references to 'peer medians' without specific competitor comparisons. While the valuation section attempts to link drivers to the fair value estimate, the lack of a structured sensitivity or scenario analysis table further limits the report's comprehensiveness. The sourcing is consistent, but the lack of industry-specific financial modeling depth prevents a higher grade.",
