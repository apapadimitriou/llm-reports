    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high analytical depth by consistently linking financial outcomes to specific business drivers rather than just describing results. Causal reasoning is evident in the explanation of margin expansion through the 'scalable nature of Visa's infrastructure' and the 'mix shift toward higher-margin services.' Inference quality is strong, as the 9\u201312% revenue CAGR is decomposed into specific growth rates for consumer (5\u20137%) and commercial (16\u201318%) segments. The report uses data effectively, benchmarking the economic moat with a historical 'ROIC averaged 87% from 2017-2022.' It distinguishes itself by quantifying uncertainty and scenarios, specifically noting that 'fee caps could reduce revenue by 1-2%' and providing a 'fair value range from $350-$420.' These elements provide clear, conditional implications for investors. Verbatim excerpts: 'driven by recovering cross-border travel'; 'reflecting the scalable nature of Visa's infrastructure'; 'fee caps could reduce revenue by 1-2%'; 'fair value ranges from $350-$420'; 'WACC is estimated at 8.5%'; 'ROIC averaged 87% from 2017-2022'.",
