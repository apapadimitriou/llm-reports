    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s assumptions are explicitly stated in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and the Appendix, covering revenue, Azure growth, and margins. However, the report fails the 'Stress-tested' pillar entirely; it provides only qualitative risk discussion without any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for material drivers like WACC or Azure growth. Crucially, the report contains a numeric contradiction: the narrative specifies a 13\u201315% annual revenue growth range through 2027, yet the financial snapshot table forecasts 15.5% growth for FY2026. Furthermore, several material model inputs\u2014specifically the effective tax rate, share count, and forward capital expenditure paths\u2014are completely omitted, rendering the valuation 'black-box' in nature. Justification is weak, as the report cites recent quarterly performance but lacks multi-year historical context or peer benchmarking to support the aggressive expansion of operating margins to 49.5%. Per the grading rubric, the combination of a numeric contradiction and the total absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
