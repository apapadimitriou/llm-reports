    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded as poor primarily due to its severe structural incompleteness and lack of internal consistency between its roadmap and content. While the narrative sections that are present\u2014such as the Analyst Note and Business Strategy\u2014utilize professional terminology and maintain consistent figures regarding product growth (e.g., Skyrizi at 72%), the document fails to provide over 40% of the sections promised in its own Table of Contents. Specifically, 'Financials Snapshot,' 'Risk & Uncertainty,' 'Capital Allocation,' 'ESG Risk,' 'Appendix,' and 'Sources' are listed but entirely absent from the text. This creates a major coherence gap, as the valuation narrative cannot be fully reconciled without the missing risk and financial data. Furthermore, the report concludes with a literal 'cliffhanger,' ending mid-sentence in the Fair Value section ('...trajectory will serve'). This abrupt termination prevents the reader from understanding the final conclusion of the profit driver analysis. Additionally, while the 'Bears Say' section raises significant concerns regarding debt levels (2.5x EBITDA) and premium valuation, these points are never addressed or reconciled within the Fair Value narrative, which remains purely optimistic. The disconnect between the promised structure and the delivered text forces the reader to assemble the missing pieces of the argument themselves, meeting the rubric's definition for a poor grade.",

        "The report ends mid-sentence: 'Revenue diversification metrics and margin trajectory will serve' (Fair Value and Profit Drivers section).",
        "Six sections listed in the 'Contents' (Financials Snapshot, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG Risk, Appendix, Sources) are missing from the body.",
        "The Bear case mentions debt levels of 2.5x EBITDA, but this is not reconciled or mentioned in the Fair Value or Analyst Note sections."
