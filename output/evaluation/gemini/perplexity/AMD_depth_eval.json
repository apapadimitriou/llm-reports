    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a professional structure with clear causal links, such as attributing revenue growth to \"continued data center momentum and AI accelerator adoption\" and margin pressure to \"regulatory headwinds and inventory adjustments.\" It explicitly lists valuation assumptions, including a \"mid-teens compound annual growth\" rate and a \"WACC of 8.5%.\" However, the analytical depth is limited by a lack of benchmarking and quantified sensitivity. While it mentions that \"sensitivity analysis indicates meaningful valuation dependence on AI-related revenue,\" it fails to provide the actual numerical results of these tests (e.g., a bull/bear price range). Assumptions are justified qualitatively (e.g., WACC reflects \"industry risk\") rather than benchmarked against specific peers or historical cycles. The implications remain somewhat generic, offering \"cautious optimism\" without conditional, decision-relevant thresholds for investors. Per the grading rules, the presence of assumptions without quantified stress-testing or benchmarking limits the grade to Fair.",
