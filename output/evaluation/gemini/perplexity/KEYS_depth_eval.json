    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong analytical depth by consistently linking financial performance to specific underlying drivers. It provides clear causal explanations, such as revenue growth 'benefiting from accelerated data center infrastructure investments' and the 'software mix shift' driving margin expansion. Assumptions are explicit and benchmarked against management's '5-7% long-term target' and historical performance. The report quantifies key expectations, including a 'WACC of 8.5%' and a '3% perpetual growth rate,' and provides a detailed financial snapshot. It identifies specific mechanisms for risk mitigation, noting management's plan to 'mitigate these costs through supply chain optimization.' However, the report falls short of an 'Excellent' grade because it lacks quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While it lists 'Key Valuation Sensitivities' in the appendix, it does not provide numerical ranges or 'if-then' impacts on the Fair-Value Estimate (e.g., how a 100bps change in margins or a failure to mitigate tariffs would specifically alter the $185 valuation). The implications are actionable but lack the rigorous stress-testing found in top-tier analysis.",
