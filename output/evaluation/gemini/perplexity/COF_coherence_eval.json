    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a professional structure with a clear narrative arc, transitioning from the strategic impact of the Discover acquisition to detailed financial projections. The language is sophisticated, and the integration of the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) reduction across the Analyst Note and Capital Allocation sections shows good structural coherence. However, a significant internal contradiction exists between the narrative and the Financials Snapshot table. The Analyst Note claims a staggering 81% year-over-year revenue decline in Q2 2025 due to acquisition accounting, yet the Financials Snapshot projects FY 2025 revenue to grow by over 56% ($42.8B vs. $27.4B in 2024). This tension is never reconciled; it is mathematically improbable for a company to suffer an 81% quarterly revenue collapse and still achieve record-breaking annual revenue growth without extraordinary explanation. Furthermore, while the text is peppered with 17 distinct citation markers, the 'Sources' section is a generic disclaimer and fails to list the actual references, undermining the report's transparency. While the Bulls/Bears are well-integrated into the broader argument, these quantitative and citation-based discrepancies trigger the 'fair' hard cap for unresolved contradictions and poor source alignment. The reader is left to bridge the gap between the dire quarterly performance and the optimistic annual forecast.",
    "evidence": [
        "The Analyst Note claims a 'revenue decline of 81% year-over-year in Q2 2025' while the Financials Snapshot table projects FY 2025E Revenue of $42.8B, a 56% increase over FY 2024A ($27.4B).",
        "The 'Sources' section contains only a legal disclaimer, leaving all 17 numerical citations in the text (e.g., [5], [16]) unreferenced and unverifiable.",
        "The report cites a 'Q2 2025 net loss of $4.3 billion' in the Analyst Note, but the Financials Snapshot table lists a positive FY 2025E EPS of $2.15 without reconciling the massive H2 recovery required."
