    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a summary of public information rather than an original piece of research. It relies heavily on restating Q2 2025 earnings data, market share statistics, and the $27 billion manufacturing announcement without adding interpretive value. There is no evidence of synthesis; for example, it fails to model the specific margin impact of the LillyDirect channel or quantify how the manufacturing scale-up specifically alters the unit cost structure relative to peers. The valuation section uses standard CAGR assumptions and boilerplate DCF drivers without a novel mechanism. The 'Bulls/Bears' and 'Moat' sections use generic industry language regarding patents and scale that could apply to any major pharmaceutical firm. Because the report lacks a single original thesis or synthesis of data into a new conclusion, and instead repeats public headlines and boilerplate phrasing, it meets the criteria for a Poor grade.",
