    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique theses, relying entirely on restating public financial data and boilerplate industry narratives. Every 'insight' identified is either a direct recap of the Q1/Q2 2025 earnings releases or a generic statement applicable to the broader investment banking sector (e.g., 'diversified revenue streams,' 'secular trends in wealth creation'). The valuation section utilizes a standard DCF model with generic growth and margin assumptions (6-8% revenue growth, 28-30% margins) without identifying a specific, novel driver or mechanism that differentiates this analysis from consensus. There is no evidence of linking disparate data points\u2014such as specific interest rate paths to deposit beta trajectories or peer-specific efficiency comparisons\u2014to reach a non-obvious conclusion. Consequently, the report lacks decision relevance as it offers no specific catalysts, testable timelines, or company-distinct angles not already available in public filings.",
