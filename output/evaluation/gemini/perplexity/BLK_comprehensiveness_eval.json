    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete and provides high-quality qualitative analysis, particularly regarding the HPS Investment Partners acquisition and the regulatory/antitrust headwinds facing the firm. However, it is strictly capped at 'Fair' due to the omission of core sector-specific KPIs within the Financials Snapshot. For an asset manager, Assets Under Management (AUM) and Net Flows (Organic Growth) are the primary drivers of the business model. While AUM is mentioned in the text, both AUM and Net Flows are absent from the multi-year Financials Snapshot table, which instead relies on generic accounting metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF). This omission violates the hard cap for sector-appropriate KPIs in the data section. Additionally, while the report provides a fair value range, it lacks a formal scenario analysis or sensitivity matrix. Peer benchmarking is also superficial, limited to qualitative mentions in the ESG section rather than a dedicated comparative analysis of market share, fee yields, or margins against competitors like Vanguard or State Street.",
