    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates 'Good' analytical depth by providing clear causal mechanisms and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. It explains margin expansion through 'scale economies offset initial AI infrastructure investments' and links revenue growth to 'AI-enhanced query expansion.' Assumptions are quantified and benchmarked, such as the '3% perpetual growth, consistent with long-term GDP' and comparisons to 'consensus estimates of $89.2 billion.' The report identifies significant uncertainties, particularly the DOJ antitrust proceedings, and provides a quantified 'fair values ranging from $185 to $235.' However, it does not reach the 'Excellent' level because it lacks extensive, conditional scenario analysis; while a range is provided, the report does not quantify the specific impact of individual variables (e.g., mapping a specific price drop to a Chrome divestiture). The implications are actionable, noting that 'uncertainty constrains valuation expansion,' which provides a clear framework for investor decision-making. The use of data is consistent, and the distinction between core growth and regulatory risk is well-maintained throughout the analysis.",
