    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows the required structural framework and provides a professional narrative with consistent citations. However, it fails to achieve a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to several critical omissions. Most notably, the Financials Snapshot table is generic and lacks core sector-specific KPIs essential for a payments network, such as Payment Volume, Cross-border Volume, and Processed Transactions. While some of these figures are mentioned in the Analyst Note, their absence from the multi-year forecast table triggers a hard cap on the grade. Additionally, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking section or comparative table, providing only passing mentions of competitors like Mastercard or PayPal. There is no formal scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., Bull/Bear case modeling) beyond a brief mention of a price range. While the valuation section links drivers to the fair value estimate, the lack of depth in operational KPI forecasting and peer context results in a report that feels structurally complete but analytically thin in key areas.",
