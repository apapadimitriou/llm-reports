    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the originality test as it functions primarily as a high-quality summary of public earnings data and news headlines rather than providing unique, value-added analysis. Every major insight identified is a direct restatement of the provided source material or a generic industry trope. For instance, the $13 billion AI run rate and the 33% Azure growth figures are pulled directly from fiscal Q2 and Q3 2025 earnings reports without further interpretive commentary. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' and 'Economic Moat' sections utilize boilerplate phrasing common to the sector (e.g., 'network effects,' 'switching costs') without offering a company-specific angle that isn't already public knowledge. Most critically, the report lacks any original synthesis or a testable, non-obvious thesis. The valuation section relies on standard DCF assumptions and consensus growth rates (13-15%) without introducing a novel driver or mechanism. Per the grading instructions, the absence of original synthesis or a unique thesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",
