    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a 'fair' grade primarily due to significant temporal and citation misalignments that undermine its credibility as a professional equity research document. While the narrative structure is logical and the sections are well-integrated, the report contains a major temporal inaccuracy: it claims to analyze 'delivered' Q2 2025 results in a report dated July 15, 2025. In the semiconductor industry, Q2 earnings (for the period ending June 30) are typically not released until late July or early August. This 'recent' claim is further compromised by the bibliography, where Source 6\u2014used to support these 2025 earnings figures\u2014is dated August 2, 2021. This suggests a failure to reconcile the provided source data with the narrative timeline. Beyond this, the report shows good structural coherence. The Analyst Note effectively synthesizes the 'Bulls Say' (AI growth) and 'Bears Say' (export controls) arguments, specifically referencing the $1.5 billion revenue headwind. The transition from the business strategy to the fair value estimate is smooth, and the financials snapshot table aligns with the narrative's 2024 actuals. However, the tension between the reported Q2 EPS of $0.48 and the full-year 2025 estimate of $2.89 is left unaddressed, requiring the reader to assume a massive, unexplained back-half acceleration. Because of the hard cap on temporal inaccuracies and the reliance on misdated sources, the grade is capped at fair.",
    "evidence": [
        "Report claims 'Advanced Micro Devices delivered mixed second quarter 2025 results' (Analyst Note) despite being dated July 15, 2025, which is ahead of typical reporting cycles.",
        "Source 6 is used to cite 2025 earnings data but is listed in the bibliography as being from 'August 2, 2021' (Sources).",
        "The Financials Snapshot projects a FY 2025E EPS of $2.89, which contradicts the narrative of 'mixed' Q2 results ($0.48) without explaining the required 100% EPS growth in the second half of the year."
