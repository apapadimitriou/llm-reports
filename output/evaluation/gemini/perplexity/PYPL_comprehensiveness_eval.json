    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required structural sections and maintains a professional, data-driven tone. It successfully links operating drivers (Venmo monetization, transaction margins) to the fair value estimate of $85. However, the report is subject to a 'Hard Cap' of 'Fair' due to the omission of core sector-specific KPIs in the Financials Snapshot table. While Total Payment Volume (TPV) and Active Accounts are mentioned in the narrative, the multi-year forecast table is generic, lacking TPV, Take Rate, and Active Account growth projections\u2014the primary health indicators for a payments company. Furthermore, while competitors like Apple Pay and Stripe are mentioned, there is no formal peer benchmarking table or comparative analysis of multiples/margins. The mention of a sensitivity range is noted, but the lack of a structured scenario analysis or sensitivity table prevents the report from reaching a higher grade. The sourcing is consistent, but the depth of the financial data is insufficient for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating.",
