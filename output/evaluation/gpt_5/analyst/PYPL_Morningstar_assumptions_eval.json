    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are largely explicit and placed near the valuation section, with clear magnitudes and horizons (e.g., five-year revenue CAGR, annual margin bps change, COE/WACC, tax rate, Stage II parameters, share count). Specificity is solid: units, time frames, and definitions (adjusted margins) are provided, and the model table quantifies revenue, margins, EPS, and shares annually. Justification is partial: narrative references secular electronic payments growth and scalability, but numeric inputs like COE/WACC, tax rate, and Stage II growth/investment rates have minimal linkage to market data, history, or peer benchmarks. Consistency suffers a notable issue: the text\u2019s \u201c6% revenue CAGR\u201d contrasts with the model\u2019s five-year revenue CAGR of 5.5%, and the annual path includes low growth in 2025. Sensitivity/stress testing is absent; no quantified ranges or scenario impacts are provided for material levers (revenue growth, margins, WACC/COE, or terminal assumptions), which caps the grade. Overall, the report offers clear, traceable assumptions with good specificity, but limited empirical justification and no quantified sensitivities, plus one numeric contradiction between narrative and tables.",
