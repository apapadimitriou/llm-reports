    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a cohesive, well-sequenced argument from industry context to company specifics, valuation, and risks. Sections reference each other explicitly: the Strategy/Outlook sets expectations for normalized post-pandemic growth and sensitivity to macro factors, which the Valuation section operationalizes via a 12% net revenue CAGR and margin trajectory; subsequent Analyst Notes echo these dynamics with concrete quarterly data. Terminology is generally consistent, with clear distinctions between net revenue versus gross revenue bases for margins, and client incentives are repeatedly tied back to gross margin behavior across sections, reinforcing the thesis. Temporal alignment is precise, with dated fair value (Feb 25, 2025) and subsequent notes (through Jun 2025) consistently maintaining the $500 FVE and overvaluation stance reflected in the star rating and Price/FVE metrics. Tables and narrative align: the DCF assumptions (9% cost of equity, share count, stage structure) match the stated fair value rationale and revisions history, while the operating margin improvement on net revenue is reconciled with essentially flat margins on a gross basis due to rising client incentives. Minor rough edges remain, such as differing descriptors for 2024 volume metrics and the coexistence of different margin bases across sections, but these are explained or inferable and do not create material contradictions. Overall, the report reads as a single, connected argument with smooth transitions and cross-references.",
