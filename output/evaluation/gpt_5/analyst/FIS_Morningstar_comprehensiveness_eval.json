    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is broadly well-structured and covers nearly all expected sections: cover and contents, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, and an extensive Financials Snapshot with multi-year history and forecasts. Evidence integration is strong via detailed tables (revenue, margins, ROIC, leverage) and dated Analyst Notes, and the valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (4% revenue CAGR, margin improvements, cost of equity) to the fair value through a DCF summary. Peer context is present via competitor comparisons and ESG peer analysis, supporting industry positioning without redundancy; the recurring theme of \u201cmore stable, lower growth\u201d appears in Strategy and Analyst Notes but is accompanied by new quarterly details. The main gaps are in sector-specific KPIs within the Financials Snapshot: for payment processing/bank tech, metrics like TPV, take rate/yield, recurring revenue percentage, ARR/NRR, and client retention/backlog are absent from the tables. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is referenced conceptually but not provided for the company. While sourcing relies primarily on Morningstar\u2019s internal analysis and ESG data, the in-report evidence is consistent. The omission of multiple core sector KPIs caps comprehensiveness at Fair despite otherwise solid coverage.",
