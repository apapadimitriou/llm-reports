    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is generally strong: the report states key drivers near the valuation (segment growth rates, efficiency and compensation ratio targets, leverage path, share count, and cost of equity). Specificity is solid, with clear magnitudes, units, and time horizons (e.g., \u201c3% annually\u201d for IB/trading; \u201c60% efficiency ratio\u2026by the end of the decade\u201d; \u201cjust north of 15 times leverage\u201d). Justification is partial: while the narrative references business mix shifts, historical ROE, and industry dynamics, most numeric inputs (COE, terminal/Stage II growth, margin targets) lack cited sources or peer/benchmark ties within the valuation section. Consistency has a notable issue: the text sets COE at 9.5%, while the \u201cKey Valuation Drivers\u201d table shows 9.0%, an unresolved numeric contradiction. Sensitivity/stress testing is absent for material levers\u2014no quantified ranges or scenario impacts on valuation for rates/NII, trading, margins, or ROE\u2014triggering a hard cap at Fair. Overall, the assumptions are clear and specific but only modestly justified, with one contradiction and no quantitative sensitivities.",
