    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are explicitly stated and proximate to forecasts: consolidated revenue CAGR (17% 2025\u20132029, 33% in 2025, ~13% 2026\u20132029), segment CAGRs (data center 20%, client 16%, gaming 20%, embedded 5%), AI GPU revenue path ($8.2B in 2025 to $17.9B in 2029), margin trajectory (gross to 57% by 2027; operating to 35% by 2029), and valuation inputs (COE/WACC 9%, long-run tax 15%, Stage II parameters, shares 1,637). Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and timeframes are provided and tables reconcile for growth rates and share count. Justification is partial: some references to management long-term targets, historical margin expansion, and industry context (Nvidia dominance, TAM >$500B) but limited tie-ins to multi-year history/peer benchmarks for WACC/tax or margin targets. Internal consistency appears mostly clean; adjusted vs GAAP margin references are somewhat ambiguous but not definitively contradictory to the tables. Stress testing is absent; no quantified sensitivities or scenario ranges are provided for material levers (AI GPU adoption, margins, WACC, China policy). Given explicitness and specificity but weak justification and no sensitivities, the assumptions quality is Fair.",
