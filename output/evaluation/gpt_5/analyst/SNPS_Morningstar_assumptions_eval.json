    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are largely explicit and proximal to the forecasts: segment CAGRs, margin trajectory, discount rate/WACC, tax rate, Stage II parameters, and projected share count are clearly stated with units and time horizons. Specificity is solid, with quantified paths (e.g., 22%\u219231% operating margin by 2034; EDA/IP CAGRs; 21% tax; WACC 7.5%; Stage II EBI growth 9.7%, investment rate 30%; perpetuity year 20). Justification is partial: narrative links to AI, chip complexity, and system-level demand support the growth/margin outlook, and business quality is cited to justify a low cost of equity; however, assumptions lack consistent evidence from multi-year history/peer benchmarks for magnitudes, and sources are not cited. Internal consistency has notable issues: China revenue share is stated as ~11% vs ~15% elsewhere, and 2024 operating margin is 22% in text vs 23.0% in the table. Sensitivity/stress testing is absent; no quantified ranges or scenarios are provided for key levers (growth, margins, discount rate), despite narrative references to China scenarios. Overall, explicitness and specificity are good, but contradictions and the lack of quantified sensitivities cap the assessment.",
