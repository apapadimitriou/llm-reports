    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s core assumptions are explicit and proximal to the forecasts they inform. Key drivers\u2014segment CAGRs (retail 8%, AWS 16%, ads 17%), total revenue CAGR (~10% to 2028), margin expansion (2024 to 2029), discount rate (COE 9%, WACC 8.7%), tax rate (21%), and share count (11)\u2014are clearly stated with units and horizons, and they reconcile well to the valuation tables. Specificity is solid, with magnitudes and timeframes provided, plus DCF stage parameters (Stage II EBI growth 8.8%, perpetuity year 20) and an EV/sales and FCF yield implication. Justification is partial: the narrative links growth and margin expansion to AWS/ads outperformance and operational efficiencies, and offers limited peer context (e.g., ad margins vs. Facebook) but lacks systematic multi-year historical or benchmark evidence tied to each numeric input. Internal consistency appears clean; table values broadly align with stated trajectories, with only minor rounding differences. However, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers (e.g., revenue CAGRs, margin path, WACC), which caps the assessment. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified and not stress-tested.",
