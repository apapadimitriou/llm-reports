    "summary_reasoning": "This report exhibits strong analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms, explicit assumptions, quantified forecasts, and multiple scenario analyses tied to decision-relevant implications. Causal links are articulated, such as margins staying flat because \u201cdepreciation charges from investments in AI offset any efficiency gains,\u201d and expected Cloud reacceleration due to capacity additions. Assumptions are explicit and often benchmarked: \u201cGoogle Search\u2026 compound annual growth rate (6%)\u201d versus a 10% broader digital ad market, and valuation inputs like \u201cWeighted Average Cost of Capital % 9.0.\u201d Quantification is extensive, spanning a DCF with detailed model drivers, segment growth (Cloud 26% annually), and fair value outcomes. Uncertainty and counterpoints are treated via antitrust and AI dynamics, with quantified bear/bull cases (FVE $175 and $266) and a conditional macro sensitivity: \u201cwe\u2019d expect a 10% fair value estimate decrease\u201d if tariffs persist. Actionable implications are provided through conditional valuations and segment drivers (e.g., TAC at \u201cpay roughly 20%-23% of its advertising revenue\u201d). Verbatim excerpts: \u201ctop line growing at an 10% compound annual growth rate\u201d; \u201cGoogle Search\u2026 compound annual growth rate (6%)\u201d; \u201cdepreciation charges from investments in AI offset any efficiency gains\u201d; \u201csearch sales declining at a 4% annual rate\u201d; \u201cpay roughly 20%-23% of its advertising revenue\u201d; \u201cwe\u2019d expect a 10% fair value estimate decrease.\u201d",
