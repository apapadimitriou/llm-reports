    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are generally explicit, numerically stated, and proximate to the forecasts they inform. The report clearly specifies a five-year revenue CAGR (~10%), margin trajectory (non-GAAP operating margin to expand modestly), capital costs (COE 9%, WACC 8.8%), long-run tax rate (11%), Stage II growth (9.1%), and share count (projected diluted shares 428), all of which reconcile to the forecast tables and DCF summary. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons are provided, and the multi-year forecast tables anchor the narrative. Justification is partial: the revenue and margin assumptions are qualitatively motivated by pricing, cross-sell/upsell, AI monetization, and market size, but there is limited quantitative benchmarking to history or peers for WACC, tax rate, or Stage II parameters. Internal consistency appears clean; GAAP vs non-GAAP margins are distinguished, and forecast revisions align with the stated fair value change. However, the report lacks quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis on material drivers (growth, margins, WACC, tax), beyond a single directional statement on how much growth would need to fall to match the market price, so stress-testing is absent. Given the hard cap for missing sensitivities, the overall assumption quality is Fair despite otherwise clear and coherent inputs.",
