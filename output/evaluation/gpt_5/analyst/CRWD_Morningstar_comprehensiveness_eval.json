    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is broadly well-structured and covers nearly all expected sections: cover and contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, Appendix, and a detailed Financials Snapshot with multi-year history and forecasts. The valuation is explicitly linked to operating drivers, including revenue growth, margin trajectories, and a full DCF (WACC, tax rate, stage assumptions), and peer context is present via competitor comparisons. Sector-appropriate SaaS/cybersecurity KPIs (ARR, net retention, gross retention, net new ARR) appear in narrative and Analyst Notes. However, the Financials Snapshot tables themselves omit at least two core sector KPIs (ARR/NRR/gross retention), which triggers the Fair cap. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is not included in the document (though referenced as available elsewhere). Evidence is generally consistent with dated data points and the ESG section sourced to Sustainalytics; redundancy is minimal despite repeated outage context across sections. Overall, comprehensiveness is strong, but missing KPIs within the snapshot tables and lack of scenarios constrain the grade.",
