    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are largely explicit and proximate to forecasts, with several quantified inputs: GLP-1 market size and Lilly\u2019s share, US pricing trajectory, 2025 revenue growth, margin path, WACC/COE, long-run tax rate, Stage II EBI growth, and projected shares. Specificity is generally solid (magnitudes, units, and 10-year horizons are stated), and many items reconcile to the model tables (e.g., operating margin rising toward ~46%). However, justification is partial: assumptions cite competitive dynamics and payer trends but lack multi-year historical benchmarks, peer comps, or external sources for parameters like WACC (7.3%), 19% tax, and 5% Stage II EBI growth. Internal consistency has a notable issue: the text\u2019s \u201c34%\u201d 2025 top-line growth conflicts with the table\u2019s 31.4%. Most importantly, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis on the material levers (GLP-1 adoption, pricing, margins, WACC), aside from isolated industry-wide tariff commentary; per the hard caps, this limits the grade. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific, with largely clean reconciliation to the model, but limited evidentiary backing and no sensitivity work cap the assessment at Fair.",
