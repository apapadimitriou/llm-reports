    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits solid analytical depth by linking drivers to outcomes and embedding explicit, quantified assumptions. It explains causality across segments\u2014data center AI strength offsetting wireless/EV softness\u2014and ties orders to future revenue (\u201corders exceeded revenue\u201d), indicating forward momentum. Mechanisms are clearly articulated, such as margin expansion via software/services (\u201cmix tilting toward software and services to expand margins\u201d) and quantified external headwinds (\u201cgross tariff impact at about $100 million\u201d). Forecasts are explicit by segment and long term (\u201cWe forecast 6% growth\u2026 midcycle\u201d), and the DCF lays out key parameters (\u201cWACC \u2026 8.7%\u201d). Assumptions are partially benchmarked using market share and peer positioning (e.g., 25% overall T&M share; 75% of 5G designs; R&D level relative to peers), supporting the moat and margin narrative. Counterpoints are addressed (wireless/automotive softness, M&A execution risk), though scenario/sensitivity analysis is not quantified. Actionable implications are present through a maintained fair value and clear conditions for recovery (AI/wired strength, expected wireless/industrial rebound). Strongest quotes: \u201cAI continues to drive growth\u201d; \u201cgross tariff impact at about $100 million\u201d; \u201corders exceeded revenue\u201d; \u201cWe forecast 6% growth\u2026 midcycle\u201d; \u201cWACC \u2026 8.7%\u201d.",
