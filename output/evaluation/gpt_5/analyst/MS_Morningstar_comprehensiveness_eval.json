    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is broadly comprehensive, covering the expected sections: cover/contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, and an extensive Financials Snapshot. Depth is proportional to the business model, with sector-appropriate KPIs for a bank/capital markets firm (NII, NIM, provisions, efficiency ratio, ROE/ROA) and clear regulatory context (Basel III, Fed stress tests). Evidence integration is strong: the valuation section links operating drivers (AUM growth, trading normalization, IB/NII growth, margins, COE) to a DCF framework, and the detailed forecast tables and DCF parameters provide traceable assumptions to the fair value. Peer benchmarking appears both in competitor comparisons and ESG peer analysis. Redundancy is minimal; recurring themes (elevated trading revenues) are developed in different contexts (strategy, earnings note, valuation). Key gaps: no scenario/sensitivity analysis applied specifically to Morgan Stanley\u2019s valuation, and CET1 is discussed in capital allocation but not tabulated in the financial snapshot. These omissions modestly limit comprehensiveness but do not trigger hard caps. Overall, the scope and linkage merit a Good rating.",
