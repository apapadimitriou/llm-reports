    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear, largely cohesive narrative: Business Strategy & Outlook sets the competitive context, the Economic Moat section deepens the structural advantages, and Fair Value and Profit Drivers ties assumptions to expected financial outcomes. Transitions like \u201cWhy it matters\u201d and \u201cThe bottom line\u201d help readability, and sections cross-reference recurring themes (scale, technology, deposit costs, NII/NIM). Tables generally reinforce the text, with consistent metrics for efficiency ratio improvements and NII growth. However, there are a few internal inconsistencies between narrative and model that limit coherence. Most notably, the Fair Value section states a 9.5% cost of equity, while the Valuation Model shows 9.0%, and midcycle ROTE is cited at ~14% while the forecast table tops out near 13.3%. There\u2019s also a minor misalignment in fair value timing: the narrative indicates the fair value was increased on Apr 3, 2025, but the price/fair value panel and model are labeled \u201cas of Feb 4, 2025.\u201d These are not fatal to understanding, but they constitute unaddressed contradictions among assumptions and tables, triggering a cap under the rubric. Despite this, the language is clear, sections are well-linked, and temporal references and cited sources (e.g., Dealogic, stress tests) align, making the report understandable with limited effort.",
