    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report covers nearly all expected sections with solid depth: a clear cover block and contents, timely Analyst Notes, detailed Business Description and Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, a robust Economic Moat discussion, and an explicit Valuation & Profit Drivers section that ties operating drivers (AUM growth, fee compression, product mix, ETF scalability, alternatives/technology) to revenue, margins, and the DCF outcome. It also includes Risk & Uncertainty, thorough Capital Allocation, ESG risk assessment, and multi-year Financials with forecasts. Peer context is present via competitor comparisons and ESG peer analysis, and scenario analysis (bull/bear cases) is included. Evidence is internally consistent with dates and quantitative tables throughout, and redundancy is minimal. The main gap is the Financials Snapshot\u2019s omission of core asset-management KPIs: it does not tabulate AUM, net flows/organic growth, or fee realization rates, nor does it show ETF share or alternatives fundraising in the KPI tables. While these metrics appear in narrative, the Snapshot lacks them, triggering the KPI hard cap. Explicit source citations to filings are also limited. Given the strong breadth but the snapshot KPI omissions, the appropriate (lenient) grade is Fair.",
