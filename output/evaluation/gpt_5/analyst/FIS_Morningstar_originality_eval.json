    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes one clear original thesis (Worldpay\u2019s underperformance driven by SMB underinvestment and operational missteps rather than flawed deal strategy) and several company-specific syntheses (private ownership with GTCR capital improving Worldpay\u2019s investment capacity; strategic fit of issuer processing and a clean break aiding FIS\u2019s transition to stable FCF; quantifying buybacks at ~9% of market cap as aligned with the new strategy; peer-relative lag due to large-merchant/UK exposure). These are decision-relevant and distinct to FIS. However, the valuation section is largely boilerplate\u2014standard CAGR and 40 bps annual margin expansion with a 7.5% cost of equity\u2014without novel mechanisms or drivers, which caps originality. Most quantitative specifics are limited to broad forecasts and buyback sizing; catalysts/timelines are sparse beyond general transition and margin expectations. While originality exceeds pure restatement, the analysis still leans on familiar moat/stability themes and conventional DCF framing, constraining actionability. Under the hard caps (no novel valuation driver), the grade cannot exceed Fair.",
