    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear mechanisms, explicit assumptions, quantified forecasts, some scenario framing, and decision-relevant implications. Causally, it links outcomes to drivers (asset sensitivity, asset cap removal, cost initiatives), for example: \u201cNIM to compress slightly to around 2.70% in 2025\u201d due to lower rates and asset sensitivity, and \u201casset cap removal will translate into higher deposit growth,\u201d improving efficiency. Assumptions are explicit and quantified across valuation and operations: \u201cfederal-funds rate to reach 2.50% by the end of 2027,\u201d \u201cterminal return on tangible equity of roughly 14.3%,\u201d and \u201c2.5% noninterest revenue compounded annual growth rate.\u201d The work benchmarks several points versus peers (deposit funding mix, GSIB surcharge, efficiency by segment) and ties ROTE to a 9% COE. It employs quantification throughout (NIM paths, NII growth, efficiency trajectory), and includes scenario-like ranges: stress buffer outcomes and a macro bear case (\u201cmidteens percentage fair value estimate decrease\u201d) alongside guidance ranges (\u201cNIM of 2.66% in 2026,\u201d \u201cstress capital buffers fall by 1.2 percentage points\u201d). Uncertainty is discussed (regulatory, macro, capital return constraints) with identified mechanisms. Actionable implications are clear and conditional, e.g., capital return decisions at premiums: \u201cdon\u2019t repurchase $1 worth of shares for $1.25.\u201d While rate/NIM sensitivities to shocks are not explicitly modeled, the report still provides mechanism-rich reasoning, quantified ranges, and investor-relevant takeaways.",
