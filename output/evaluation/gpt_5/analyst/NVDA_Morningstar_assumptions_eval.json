    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report states key modeling inputs close to the forecasts they drive, especially in Fair Value and Profit Drivers and in the DCF key drivers (e.g., quarterly DC revenue, annual DC CAGRs, gross/operating margins, WACC, tax rate, Stage II parameters, share count). Specificity: Assumptions include magnitudes, units, and time horizons (e.g., $49.4B/$53.9B DC quarters; 35%/15% DC growth; GM 71%/74%; WACC 9%; long-run tax 15%; Stage II EBI growth 11%, investment rate 34.3). Consistency: Figures reconcile across narrative and the valuation/tables; numbers for DC revenue and margins tie to the model summary. Minor dated tensions exist across sections, but the core financial assumptions align with the presented tables. Justification: The narrative cites recent guidance, supply constraints, China H20 policy reversal, historical DC growth, and hyperscaler capex trends to motivate revenue growth and margin durability. However, several valuation parameters (WACC 9%, Stage II 11% EBI growth, 34.3% investment rate) lack explicit sourcing or peer/market benchmarks, and long-term growth paths are not cross-checked with external data. Sensitivity: There is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for material drivers (e.g., DC growth, margins, China scenarios, WACC), limiting stress-testing. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific with partial justification, but the absence of quantified sensitivities caps the grade at Fair.",
