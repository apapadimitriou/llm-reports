    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report states many core drivers near the forecasts they inform, including product peak sales, IRA-related US sales step-downs, WACC/COE/debt costs, tax rate, and Stage II DCF parameters. Specificity: Assumptions are quantitatively specific with units and horizons (e.g., \u201c2% step-down in US sales,\u201d \u201c60% probability,\u201d \u201cStage II EBI Growth 3.5%,\u201d product peak sales by year), and tie to revenue, margin, and valuation. Justification: Rationale is partial\u2014some inputs reference product histories, competitive context, and policy (IRA), but key parameters (WACC, tax rate, GLP-1 market size) lack cited sources or peer/market benchmarks. Consistency: Most figures reconcile to tables, but at least one numeric inconsistency exists (16% tax in text vs 17% long-run tax in the DCF table). Maritide sales expectations shift across sections/dates without a clear reconciliation, though they may reflect updates. Sensitivity: There is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis on material drivers (e.g., maritide uptake/market size, WACC, margins, IRA impacts), so valuation impact feels single-point. Overall, assumptions are relatively explicit and specific but weakly justified and not stress-tested; minor internal inconsistencies are present, capping the grade at Fair.",
