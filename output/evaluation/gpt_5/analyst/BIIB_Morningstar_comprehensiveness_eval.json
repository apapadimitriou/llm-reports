    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections with solid proportionality for a biopharma name: a clear cover block and contents, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, and a robust Financials Snapshot with multi-year history and forecasts. Sector-appropriate detail is provided in narrative form (product-level peak sales assumptions, pipeline milestones like AHEAD 3-45, regulatory approvals for Leqembi), and the valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (MS declines, Ocrevus royalties, Spinraza stabilization, IRA impact) to the fair value via DCF parameters (WACC, tax rate). Evidence integration is consistent within Morningstar\u2019s framework, and peer/industry context appears via competitor metrics and references to Roche/Novartis, plus ESG peer analysis. Redundancy is minimal despite repeated mention of Leqembi; each section adds distinct depth (fair value changes, EU approval, formulation timelines). The principal gaps are the absence of explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis and a lack of tabular sector KPIs (e.g., pipeline stage table). However, the narrative compensates for KPI coverage. Overall, comprehensiveness is strong, with the missing scenarios modestly constraining the grade.",
