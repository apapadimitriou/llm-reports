    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains a handful of syntheses but largely restates well-known narratives and company guidance. Notably, it offers two quantified, sector-level syntheses: the 24% US revenue hit from European price alignment and a 2-percentage-point operating margin headwind (6% profit hit) from a hypothetical 25% tariff. These are useful but not AbbVie-specific. Company-focused insights include the standard Humira-to-Skyrizi/Rinvoq transition and the assertion that margin mix should remain stable as higher-margin next-gen immunology offsets Humira\u2014an interpretive synthesis but common across coverage. The pipeline monitoring signals (TL1A, \u03b14\u03b27, IL\u20111\u03b1/\u03b2 combinations, and ABBV\u2011295 obesity program) add decision-relevant timelines (2026) but stop short of a distinct, quantified thesis with mechanisms versus peers. The valuation section raises FVE on stronger immunology growth but introduces no novel drivers beyond that, and uses a standard DCF with explicit WACC/COE figures. Overall, there is some synthesis and a few company-specific, actionable watchpoints, but no original theses, limited peer contrast, and multiple generic restatements. Decision relevance is moderate, with timelines but minimal quantification tied to AbbVie outcomes, warranting a lenient Fair under the hard caps.",
