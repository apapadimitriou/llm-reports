    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is broadly structured and covers most expected equity research sections: cover/contents, a timely analyst note, detailed business description, strategy and outlook, bulls/bears, a deep economic moat discussion, valuation and profit drivers, risks, capital allocation, ESG, and an extensive financials snapshot with multi-year history and forecasts. Evidence is generally integrated with dates, management attributions, and quantitative tables, and peer context is provided via competitor comparisons. Valuation assumptions appear linked to operating drivers (growth by end markets, margin expansion, WACC) and culminate in a DCF summary with key parameters. However, the Financials Snapshot is largely generic and omits multiple core sector KPIs for test and measurement\u2014such as orders, book-to-bill, backlog, segment revenue mix, and recurring/software metrics\u2014despite some of these being mentioned narratively elsewhere. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is not included, and the risk section is dated (Feb 2023). Redundancy is minimal, with analyst notes adding quarter-specific depth. Overall, the missing KPIs in the snapshot cap the grade at Fair under the decision rules, even though the report is otherwise well-rounded.",
