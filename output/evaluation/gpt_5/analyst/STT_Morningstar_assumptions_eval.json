    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key assumptions are largely explicit and proximal to the forecasts via the multi-year model tables and targeted narrative points (e.g., NII +1% in 2025, fee revenue growth 3%\u20135%, expenses +2%\u20133%). Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units (USD millions, %), and horizons (2025\u20132029; perpetuity year 20) are provided; DCF drivers include a 9% cost of equity and 4% Stage II net income growth. Justification is partial: the report references historical NII behavior, pricing headwinds, deposit mix, and market sensitivity, but offers limited quantitative benchmarking to peers or external sources and does not tie COE or Stage II growth to market data. Consistency is mostly clean across narrative and tables, but one numeric inconsistency exists regarding the investment-management revenue mix (\u201cless than 15%\u201d vs \u201cabout 17%\u201d). Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for major levers (NII/NIM, fee revenue, expenses, COE, share count), which alone caps the grade at Fair. Overall: explicit and specific assumptions, partial justification, a minor contradiction, and no stress testing.",
