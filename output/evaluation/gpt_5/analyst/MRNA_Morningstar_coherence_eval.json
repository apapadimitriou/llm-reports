    "reasoning": "The report reads as a largely cohesive narrative: it opens with timely Analyst Notes, then builds through Business Strategy/Outlook, Moat, Valuation, Risks, and Capital Allocation. Transitions are generally explicit (e.g., \u201cWhy it matters\u201d and \u201cThe bottom line\u201d within notes) and cross-references are strong: the breakeven/profitability timing (2028) appears consistently in Analyst Notes, the Fair Value section, and is reflected in the forecast table (EPS turning slightly positive in 2028). Key assumptions\u2014flat ~$2 billion annual COVID sales, 2026 combo launch, and higher uncertainty in RSV\u2014carry through Strategy, Moat, and Valuation, and the DCF parameters and WACC align with the narrative of Very High uncertainty. Bulls/Bears are reconciled with the base case via lowered probabilities and tempered sales assumptions. However, there are two internal inconsistencies that cap coherence. First, Capital Allocation states \u201cWith no debt,\u201d while the financials and DCF show debt on the balance sheet and nonzero debt/capital ratios. Second, within the DCF summary, Equity Value and projected shares imply a per-share value near $83, but the table asserts a $85 fair value per share without reconciling the arithmetic. Aside from these issues, terminology is consistent and temporal claims are appropriate. Given the clear flow and alignment elsewhere, but the noted contradictions, a fair grade is warranted.",
    "evidence": [
        "Capital Allocation claims \u201cWith no debt\u2026\u201d (4 Apr 2025) vs. Financial Leverage/DCF showing Debt (e.g., Debt/Capital up to 4.5% in 2024; Debt 747 in DCF table, p.16\u201317).",
        "DCF summary (p.16\u201317): Equity Value 31,910 and Projected Diluted Shares 384 imply ~83/share, yet the table lists Fair Value per Share 85.00 with no explanation.",
        "Breakeven/profitability in 2028 is echoed across sections and supported by forecasts (EPS 0.08 in 2028; Fair Value and Profit Drivers, p.7; Analyst Notes, 1 May 2025)."
