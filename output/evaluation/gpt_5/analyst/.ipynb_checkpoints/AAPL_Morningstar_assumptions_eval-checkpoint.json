    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key modeling inputs are generally explicit and proximal to forecasts, notably revenue CAGRs, segment growth, margin trajectories, and discount-rate/tax parameters. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and timelines are provided (e.g., through fiscal 2029, percent margins, WACC, COE, tax rate, share count). Justification is partial: some causal drivers are discussed (Pro mix, services regulatory pressure, R&D-driven cost efficiency), but most major parameters (WACC/COE, long-run tax, Stage II settings, margin targets) lack citations to multi-year history or peer benchmarks. Consistency exhibits at least one numeric contradiction between narrative and tables (total revenue CAGR stated at 7% vs table\u2019s 5-year 6% CAGR), which caps the grade. Sensitivity/stress testing is limited but present: a quantified tariff downside (25% impact to earnings and intrinsic value) is offered; however, there is no robust, quantified scenario set across multiple material levers (revenue/margins/WACC) or valuation impact bands. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific, partially justified, with minor internal issues and limited quantified sensitivity\u2014appropriate for a Fair grade under the stated caps.",
