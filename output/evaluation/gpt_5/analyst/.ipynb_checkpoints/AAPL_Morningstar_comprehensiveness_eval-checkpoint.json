    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report is broad and well-structured, covering nearly all expected sections: a clear cover/contents, timely Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, detailed Economic Moat, a robust Valuation & Profit Drivers section with explicit DCF parameters, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, peer benchmarking, and a multi-year Financials Snapshot with forecasts. The proportional depth is solid: drivers (iPhone units/mix, services growth, margins) are tied to valuation via explicit fair value, WACC, tax rate, and DCF stage assumptions. Evidence integration is consistent within the Morningstar framework, with dated analyst notes and ESG sourced to Sustainalytics, and competitor comparisons enhancing context. Redundancy is limited; overlapping themes (ecosystem, risks) generally add new detail in each section. The principal gap is the absence of core hardware sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot (e.g., iPhone unit volumes/ASP, installed base, product or segment mix tables). While these metrics are discussed qualitatively (and some quantified in narrative, e.g., Vision Pro revenue), they are not tabulated in the snapshot, triggering a cap on comprehensiveness. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is touched on (tariff downside case) but not presented as a dedicated sensitivity table. Overall, it\u2019s close to \u201cGood,\u201d but KPI omissions in the snapshot constrain the grade.",
