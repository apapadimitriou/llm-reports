    "summary_reasoning": "The report goes beyond boilerplate in several company\u2011specific, decision\u2011relevant ways. I identified at least three strong syntheses/original theses: (1) a quantified tariff downside scenario (25% hit to earnings/intrinsic value) with clear mechanisms (145% China tariff assumption, mitigation via US price increases and shifting production) and monitoring signals; (2) the $500 billion US investment framed as a deliberate tariff\u2011avoidance strategy with a policy catalyst; and (3) the developer access to on\u2011device AI models tied to strengthening Apple\u2019s app\u2011ecosystem network effect. Additional company\u2011specific angles include supply\u2011chain details (most US iPhones imported from India at 10% vs 145% from China) and the C1 self\u2011designed modem as a vertical\u2011integration driver with timing (\u201cfew years\u201d to penetrate flagships), supporting a margin expansion thesis. These are distinct, decision\u2011relevant, and use numbers or explicit mechanisms. While there is some standard forecasting (e.g., Vision Pro reaching $4 billion by 2029, segment CAGRs), copied/generic content is limited, and the valuation section incorporates novel drivers (regulatory pressure reducing App Store take rates, hardware mix shift, in\u2011house silicon). Peer specificity (Samsung/TSMC contrasts) and catalysts (WWDC, tariff policy decisions) are present.",
