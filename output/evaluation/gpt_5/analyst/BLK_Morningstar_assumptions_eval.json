    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are explicit and concentrated in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers and Valuation Model Summary sections, with clear quantitative inputs tied to forecasts and the DCF. Specificity is strong: units, magnitudes, and horizons are stated (e.g., 2025\u201329 revenue CAGR, margin ranges, AUM organic growth, COE/WACC, long-run tax rate, Stage II EBI growth, perpetuity year). Justification is solid, referencing multi-year organic AUM growth history and margin performance and linking drivers (ETF scalability, product mix/realization rate, fee compression) to outcomes. Internal consistency between narrative and tables is clean; the key figures reconcile across sections, and the scenario targets map coherently to valuation impacts. Sensitivity is robustly handled via quantified bull/bear scenarios that vary material levers (revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, product mix/realization rate) and show fair value per-share outcomes. Overall, the report provides traceable, auditable assumptions that drive forecasts and valuation, including share count and payout frameworks, with minimal ambiguity and clear causal drivers.",
