    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear arc\u2014from Business Strategy & Outlook to Economic Moat, Fair Value and Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, and supporting tables\u2014and generally uses consistent terminology (compensation ratio, efficiency ratio, ROE). Transitions are mostly smooth, with explicit connective logic (e.g., technology investments leading to margin leverage and lower compensation ratio) and cross-references between risks (trade tensions) and valuation/trading assumptions. Bulls/Bears are reasonably reconciled to the base case, as the valuation narrative anticipates a trading normalization and acknowledges regulatory/trade uncertainty.\nHowever, there are notable internal inconsistencies that disrupt coherence. First, the wealth assets scale is contradictory: Business Strategy cites \u201c$1.6 billion\u201d in assets under supervision, while Economic Moat states \u201c$1.6 trillion\u201d for wealth management assets, a magnitude mismatch. Second, the narrative in Fair Value asserts use of a 9.5% cost of equity, but the Valuation Model Summary lists 9.0%, an unaddressed modeling discrepancy. Third, the narrative suggests achieving the lower end of 14%-16% ROE targets, yet the forecast table shows ROE remaining below 13% through 2029, without clarifying timing or drivers to bridge that gap.\nDates and recency claims align, and most sections are cohesive, but the contradictions among narrative and tables trigger an auto-cap at fair under the rubric.",
