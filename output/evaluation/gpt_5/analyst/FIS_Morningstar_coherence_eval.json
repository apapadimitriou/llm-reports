    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear, consistent narrative linking strategy, moat, valuation, risks, and capital allocation. The Business Strategy & Outlook section explains the Worldpay divestiture and reorientation toward bank tech, and this flows into the Moat discussion (switching costs in core processing) and the base-case in Fair Value & Profit Drivers (modest growth, incremental margin improvement). Cross-references are explicit: Bears cite limited visibility into Worldpay, and both the strategy and analyst notes acknowledge reduced disclosure and the desire for a cleaner break, showing alignment across sections. Assumptions and the valuation model are mostly coherent: a 4% five-year revenue CAGR and gradual adjusted EBITDA margin gains are reflected in the model\u2019s 2024\u20132029 trajectory. Temporal references are precise, and analyst notes carry forward the $88 fair value consistently. However, there is a notable internal inconsistency in the \u201cForecast Revisions\u201d table where the line labeled Net Income appears to carry adjusted figures, conflicting with the main model\u2019s separate Net Income and Adjusted Net Income lines. This terminology mismatch constitutes a contradiction within the tables. Minor formatting glitches (e.g., header dates for fair value vs later model \u2018as of\u2019 dates) do not materially impair coherence, but the mislabeled metric triggers an auto-cap under the rubric. Overall, the report is understandable with modest effort, with largely smooth transitions and sound internal alignment, aside from the table labeling issue.",

        "Fair Value & Profit Drivers: \u201cWe expect\u2026 adjusted EBITDA margins to improve at an average annual rate of 40 bps,\u201d aligned with Adjusted EBITDA margin rising from 40.2% (2024) to 42.0% (2029) in the model.",
        "Business Strategy & Outlook and Bears: Both note limited insight into Worldpay after deconsolidation, consistent with Risk and Capital Allocation discussions about reduced transparency."
