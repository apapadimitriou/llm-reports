    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report is broadly comprehensive across the expected content set. It includes a clear cover block with valuation context, a contents outline, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Competitive Positioning/Economic Moat, explicit Fair Value & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG/Controversies, Financials (multi-year history and forecasts), peer context, and an appendix with methodology and disclosures. Depth is proportional: the moat and strategy sections delve into EOS differentiation and switching costs; valuation ties specific operating drivers (AI/data center growth, campus expansion, gross/operating margin ranges) to multi-year forecasts and a DCF with WACC/tax assumptions. Evidence is consistently anchored in Morningstar\u2019s tables and dated analyst notes, with minimal redundancy across sections. Financials contain rich margin, ROIC, and FCF metrics appropriate for tech hardware, though unit/port mix detail typical for networking vendors is not included. Peer benchmarking is present (competitor comparatives and ESG peer analysis). The main gap is the absence of explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis in the report body, although a link notes scenarios are available elsewhere. Overall, the linkage from drivers to valuation and breadth of sections support a Good grade despite the lack of scenarios and limited sector-operational KPIs.",
