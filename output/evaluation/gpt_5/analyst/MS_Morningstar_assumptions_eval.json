    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are generally explicit and proximal to the forecasts they drive, with clear magnitudes and horizons (e.g., five-year CAGRs for net revenue, AUM, and NII; a stated cost of equity; Stage II parameters and share count). Specificity is solid: units, percentages, and timeframes are provided, and many figures reconcile to the model tables (e.g., NII path and net revenue growth). Justification is partial: the report references historical trading over-earning, management targets, and business mix, but offers limited benchmarking against peers and few cited sources for key parameters like COE 9% or Stage II growth 3.5%. Internal consistency shows a notable issue: \u201cacross-a-cycle operating margins of around 26%\u201d conflicts with the forecast efficiency/margin path that implies closer to ~29% in most explicit years. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis on material drivers (rates/NII, trading normalization, margins, capital rules), triggering the Fair cap under the hard rules. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific, with partial justification and one contradiction, but lack stress-testing.",
