    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s key assumptions are largely explicit and proximal to the forecasts they inform. Core valuation inputs (WACC 7.3%, COE 7.5%, long-run tax rate 21%, Stage II parameters, projected shares) are clearly stated in the Key Valuation Drivers and DCF summary, and revenue/margin trajectories are specified with magnitudes and horizons (e.g., ~6% organic growth over five years; non-GAAP/adjusted operating margin approaching ~52% by 2029; ratings growth path). Specificity is solid: units, timelines, and basis-point changes are provided, and numbers reconcile reasonably to the forecast tables. Justification is partial: the narrative supports pricing power in ratings with historical fee increases and references past margin expansion, but several pivotal valuation parameters (WACC, Stage II EBI growth, investment rate, perpetuity year) lack cited sources or peer/history benchmarking. Internal consistency is mostly clean; the margin discussion uses adjusted/non-GAAP terminology while tables show GAAP operating and adjusted EBITDA margins, creating minor definitional ambiguity rather than a hard contradiction. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis on material drivers (rates/WACC, issuance/ratings revenue, index asset-linked fees, margins), which hard-caps the grade at Fair. Overall, explicitness and specificity are strong, justification is mixed, consistency is acceptable, but the absence of stress-testing prevents a higher grade.",
