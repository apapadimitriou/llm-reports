    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is generally well structured and readable, with clear sectioning (Business Strategy & Outlook, Moat, Valuation, Risks, Capital Allocation, Analyst Notes) and consistent terminology. Transitions are mostly smooth: the Analyst Notes explicitly connect new information (tariffs, litigation, acquisition) to the unchanged $164 fair value, and the strategy narrative aligns with the wide-moat rationale. However, there is at least one material internal contradiction between the narrative and the modeling tables that undercuts coherence. In Fair Value and Profit Drivers (Jan 14, 2025), it states, \u201cWe expect fairly flat operating margins over the next several years,\u201d while the Valuation Model Summary shows operating margin rising from 24.9% (2024) to 27.2% (2025) and up to 29.1% (2029), which is not \u201cflat.\u201d This unresolved tension triggers an auto-downgrade. A secondary inconsistency appears in the Analyst Notes around the Intra-Cellular acquisition closing timing: Jan 14 cites second half of 2025, whereas Jan 22 assumes second quarter, with no reconciliation. Aside from these issues, most sections reference each other appropriately (e.g., tariff headwinds discussed in both industry notes and the earnings note, then reflected in assumptions), and dates and claims are largely aligned. Overall, the narrative is understandable and mostly cohesive, but the identified contradictions cap the grade at fair under the guardrails.",
