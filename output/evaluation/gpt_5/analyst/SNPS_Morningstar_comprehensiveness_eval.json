    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report is broadly comprehensive: it includes a cover block and contents, an up-to-date Analyst Note, detailed Business Description and Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, a thorough Economic Moat discussion with market share and retention evidence, explicit Valuation & Profit Drivers linked to operating assumptions, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG risk analysis, peer context, and a multi-year Financials snapshot with forecasts. The proportional depth is strong in moat, strategy, and valuation, and peer/industry/regulatory context is well integrated (EDA oligopoly, China export restrictions). The valuation section ties segment CAGRs, margin trajectory, and cost of equity to fair value and is supported by a DCF summary. However, the Financials snapshot table is generic and omits multiple sector-specific software/EDA KPIs (e.g., ARR/ACV, NRR, RPO/backlog, bookings), which imposes a hard cap at Fair. Evidence sourcing is largely internal and lacks in-text citations for material regulatory developments, and scenario/sensitivity analysis is absent. Redundancy is limited; repeated AI/system-level demand themes add incremental context across sections. Overall, the report is near Good on breadth and linkage, but KPI omissions and lack of scenarios keep it at Fair.",
