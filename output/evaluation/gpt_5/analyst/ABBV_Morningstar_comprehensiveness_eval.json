    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report covers all the core sections expected of a comprehensive equity research note: cover/contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, a detailed Financials Snapshot with multi-year history and forecasts, and an Appendix/Methodology. Depth is generally proportional to materiality for biopharma: it ties Humira LOE pressures to offsetting drivers (Skyrizi/Rinvoq, Botox) and discusses pipeline direction, R&D intensity, and US pricing/tariff policy risks. Evidence integration is consistent with Morningstar\u2019s model, including a full DCF summary with assumptions (WACC, tax rate, Stage II growth/investment), and explicit multi-year projections, plus recent company guidance references. Peer context is present (valuation and ESG peer tables). Redundancy is limited; repeated themes (Humira erosion, new immunology assets) add incremental detail across sections. Gaps: there is no AbbVie-specific scenario/sensitivity analysis in the report body, and the snapshot lacks a product-level revenue breakdown table; however, sector KPIs appear throughout the narrative (pipeline milestones, key product guidance, R&D %, geographic mix). These omissions modestly limit comprehensiveness but do not undermine core linkages between drivers and valuation. Overall, the report merits a Good rating.",
