    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms, explicit and quantified assumptions, scenario thinking, and decision-relevant takeaways. It explains why results occur (pipeline offsetting patent cliffs, switching costs in devices, contracting dynamics) and ties forecasts to specific drivers. Examples include quantified impacts from policy and tariffs\u2014\u201cwould result in a 24% hit to US drug revenue\u201d and \u201ca 6% headwind to operating profits\u201d\u2014as well as product-level forecasts like \u201cpeak annual sales of over $5 billion by 2028.\u201d Inference quality is solid: EPS and revenue trajectories are linked to Stelara erosion and new launches (\u201cWe assume an over $3 billion decline\u201d), and operating margins are discussed in the context of cost-containment vs. patent loss. Data use is extensive, with a detailed DCF (WACC, tax rate, Stage II growth) and industry benchmarks (\u201cUS prices are on average roughly double\u201d). The report treats uncertainty with quantified probabilities and costs (e.g., \u201clegal costs at 3% of non-GAAP net income\u201d) and outlines policy scenarios with exposure framing (\u201c10% of the US drug market\u201d). Actionable implications are clear, including maintenance of fair value, identification of watch items, and contract constraints that affect pricing (\u201cexisting contracts limit price leverage\u201d). While valuation sensitivities (e.g., WACC/terminal) are not shown, multiple quantified scenarios are provided, supporting decision-relevant analysis.",
