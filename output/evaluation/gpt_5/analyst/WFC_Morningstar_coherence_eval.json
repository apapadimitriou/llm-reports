    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear, multi-section narrative that mostly flows well from regulatory context (stress tests, asset-cap removal) to strategy, moat, valuation, and risks. Cross-references are effective: the Business Strategy & Outlook and Capital Allocation sections consistently tie the June 2025 asset-cap removal to expected efficiency improvements and growth, which is then reflected in the Fair Value & Profit Drivers and the valuation model table (e.g., operating expenses easing slightly in 2025). Terminology is used correctly (NII, NIM, ROTE), and dates across Analyst Notes align with the stated events, giving the report a coherent temporal arc. However, there is a material internal inconsistency between the narrative and the valuation tables regarding net interest margin. The Fair Value & Profit Drivers text forecasts NIM compression to about 2.70% in 2025 and 2.66% in 2026 as rates fall, but the Margins & Returns table shows NIM rising to 2.8% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026. This tension is not addressed elsewhere and triggers the hard cap. Aside from this, Bulls/Bears are reasonably reconciled with the base-case (rate sensitivity and expense control) and most quantitative assumptions align with the story. With one notable contradiction, the report remains understandable but internally noisy at that point.",
