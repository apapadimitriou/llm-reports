    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are mostly explicit and proximate to the forecasts: revenue growth, margins, WACC/COE, tax rate, Stage II DCF inputs, and share count are stated with figures and horizons. Specificity is solid: the report quantifies 5% average annual top-line growth through 2029, operating margin trajectory in tables, WACC 7.0% with COE 7.5% and pre-tax debt 6.5%, long-run tax rate 19%, Stage II EBI growth 5%, investment rate 15%, and perpetuity year 20, plus projected diluted shares. Justification is partial: narrative cites product efficacy/launch momentum (Skyrizi/Rinvoq) and industry policy/tariff context, but offers limited reconciliation for the sharp margin expansion beyond \u201cfairly stable,\u201d and WACC inputs lack cited sources. Consistency has one clear numeric contradiction between tables (2025 net income), triggering the Fair cap. Sensitivity is present and quantified at the industry level (24% US price alignment impact; 25% tariff \u21d2 ~2-pt margin headwind, assumed ending by 2026), but not tied to AbbVie-specific valuation deltas. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific, with partial justification and quantified but broad sensitivities; the single contradiction and lack of AbbVie-specific scenario valuation impacts cap the grade at Fair.",
