    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth through explicit causal drivers tied to forecasts and a fully articulated DCF. Causal explanations link product adoption and mix to revenue and margins (for example, \u201cshould support estimated 4% top-line growth\u201d and \u201cpeak at 21% in fiscal 2029\u201d). Inference quality is supported by quantified, segment-level growth assumptions (cardiovascular 4%, neuroscience 5%), margin expansion (200 bps to 21%), and DCF parameters (\u201cWeighted Average Cost of Capital % 7.1\u201d; \u201cStage II EBI Growth Rate % 6.0\u201d). The use of data is extensive, with multi-year revenue/EPS forecasts, ROIC trajectory, and detailed valuation inputs. Counterpoints and uncertainty are acknowledged (capacity limits: \u201cappeared to slow down some labor-intensive procedures\u201d; reimbursement: \u201cMedicare's decision to establish a transitional pass-through payment\u201d), and risks like recalls, regulatory scrutiny, and tariff pressures are discussed. However, sensitivities and scenarios are not quantified\u2014there\u2019s no range analysis or EPS impact for adverse events (e.g., reduced adoption or reimbursement cuts). Actionable implications emerge conditionally from drivers (new therapy adoption and pass-through status) and margin programs (\u201cto defend against pricing erosion\u201d). Overall, explicit assumptions and mechanism-rich reasoning are present, but the absence of quantified scenario/sensitivity analysis caps the grade at Good.",
