    "summary_reasoning": "The report delivers multiple company-specific syntheses and at least one original thesis, with clear mechanisms, peer contrasts, and quantification. I identified 5 decision-relevant insights that go beyond restating public information: linking Farapulse/Watchman adoption and tariffs to a higher FVE, quantifying the ~$200m tariff headwind (tied to ~7% China exposure) and offset plan, detailing EP share shifts versus J&J/Abbott and how Faraview/Farawave Nav threaten their mapping/nav incumbency, projecting a 27% operating margin by 2029 tied to specific category drivers and recent M&A, and outlining trial catalysts (OPTION 2025, CHAMPION 2026) for Watchman. An additional original thesis posits PFA capturing >90% of ablations based on safety/efficiency and early adoption evidence. Generic moat language and sector boilerplate do appear, but they are a minority. The valuation section is not a bare DCF; it incorporates novel drivers (PFA/Watchman acceleration, tariffs, acquisition contribution) and quantifies implications. With 4+ clear syntheses/original theses, numbers (e.g., 172% EP growth, 11% top-line CAGR, 27% OM), and explicit catalysts/timelines, the report is decision-relevant and distinct to Boston Scientific\u2019s competitive context. Boilerplate elements are present but do not dominate.",
