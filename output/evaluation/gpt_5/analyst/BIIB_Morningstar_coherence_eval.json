    "reasoning": "The report presents a generally coherent narrative arc\u2014from Business Strategy & Outlook through Moat, Valuation, Risks, and Capital Allocation\u2014with clear language and consistent use of key terms (e.g., WACC at 7.1%, narrow moat, Leqembi peak sales assumptions). Sections reference each other meaningfully: Leqembi\u2019s ramp and uncertainty anchor Strategy, Moat, and Valuation; IRA effects appear in both Valuation and Risk. Tables largely support the text (e.g., Ocrevus peak sales assumptions, revenue/margin trajectories). However, there are material internal contradictions that break full coherence. In Economic Moat, the text states ROICs will exceed the 7.1% cost of capital by 2026, but the Valuation Model shows ROIC below 7.1% until 2029, without reconciliation. Similarly, Spinraza is described as remaining around $2 billion in Strategy, while Valuation assumes stabilization at $1.5 billion; both are dated Feb 13, 2025, creating unresolved tension. These discrepancies trigger the rubric\u2019s hard cap. Despite these issues, cross-references are mostly explicit (e.g., Leqembi subcutaneous approvals influencing the sales ramp in Analyst Notes and Valuation), and temporal claims appear consistent with dates provided. Overall, understandable with some effort, but internally noisy due to contradictions between narrative and the model.",

        "Fair Value (13 Feb 2025) and earlier narrative both align on Ocrevus peak sales of $9 billion, supporting cross-section consistency."
