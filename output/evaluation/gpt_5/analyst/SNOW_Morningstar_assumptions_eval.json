    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key model drivers are stated clearly and proximate to the forecasts they inform. The report explicitly quantifies: FY26 guidance (product revenue growth and non-GAAP margin), multi-year revenue CAGRs, long-term gross margin and GAAP operating margin trajectories, and a forecast path for diluted shares and revenues. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and time horizons are provided (e.g., margins from FY25 to FY35; 5- and 10-year revenue CAGRs; multi-year share count). However, justification is limited. The narrative cites AI demand, cloud migrations, and scale leverage, but does not tie the long-run margin targets or revenue CAGRs to multi-year company history, peer benchmarks, or sourced evidence; WACC/COE, terminal growth, tax rate, and capex/working-capital assumptions are omitted. Internal consistency between text and tables appears largely clean, with negative GAAP operating margins in the near term aligning with the long-run margin path; no clear numeric contradictions are evident. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis on material drivers (e.g., revenue growth bands, margin progression, SBC intensity, valuation impact), so assumptions are not stress-tested. Given explicitness and specificity but weak justification and no sensitivities, the appropriate cap applies, resulting in a Fair grade.",
