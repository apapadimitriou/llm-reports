    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are generally explicit and proximal to the forecasts they inform, with clear magnitudes and horizons. Key growth drivers (companywide revenue CAGR, segment growth for Search/YouTube/Cloud), margin trajectory, WACC/COE, and tax rate are stated and tied to the valuation table. Specificity is solid: units (% CAGR, margin %, years), and causal drivers (AI investments, cloud capacity, TAC) are described. Justification is partial-to-solid: the report references recent results, multi-year share count reduction, segment mix history (Cloud 12% of 2024 top line), and industry context (digital ad market growth), though external citations/peer benchmarks are limited and some parameters (WACC, Stage II growth) lack sourcing. Consistency across narrative and the model appears clean; the revenue CAGR reconciles to the table and the \u201cflat ~32%\u201d margin comment aligns with a near-flat path in the model. Stress-testing is present but limited: quantified bear/bull cases for Search with fair value impacts and a tariff scenario (\u221210% FVE) provide sensitivity on material levers, albeit not across all inputs (e.g., no WACC/margin sensitivity). Overall, the assumptions are explicit, specific, internally coherent, and include some quantified scenarios.",
