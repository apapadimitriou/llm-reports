    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are largely explicit and near the forecasts they inform. The report states revenue contributions by program (covid ~$2 billion annually; non-covid vaccines $7 billion by 2034; oncology $3 billion by 2034; rare disease $1 billion by 2034) and margin/WACC/tax/share assumptions. Specificity is solid: magnitudes (USD), probabilities (20%-60%), and time horizons (2025\u20132034) are quantified; DCF parameters (WACC 9%, long-run tax 21%, Stage II settings) are numerically defined. Consistency is clean; narrative figures reconcile with the model summary (e.g., 2028 revenue cut to $5.5 billion aligns with table; WACC and shares match the valuation section). Justification is partial: historical sales and competitive context are referenced, but probabilities of approval, long-term margins (>40%), Stage II EBI growth (10%), and $7 billion non-covid sales lack cited sources or peer benchmarks. Stress-testing is absent: no quantified sensitivities or scenario ranges are shown for material drivers (covid demand, vaccine uptake, pricing/margins, WACC). Given explicit and specific inputs but limited evidence and no sensitivities, the assumptions quality fits Fair, with no contradictions detected.",
