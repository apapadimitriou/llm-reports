    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is broadly comprehensive, covering all core sections expected in equity research for a trust/custody bank: cover block and contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG/controversies, and an Appendix with methodology and disclosures. Depth is appropriate and sector-specific: pricing compression, AUC/A and AUM, NII/NIM dynamics, fee mix, and capital ratios are discussed. The Financials Snapshot provides multi-year history and explicit forecasts, including NIM, efficiency ratio, provisions, ROE/ROA, ROTE, and dividends, with a clear DCF framework and parameters; the valuation section explicitly ties fee revenue and NII assumptions to the updated fair value. Peer context is present via competitor comparisons and ESG peer analysis. Evidence is consistently drawn from company data and named sources (Barron\u2019s, SEC settlements), and ESG controversies are covered. Redundancy is limited, with sections adding incremental detail rather than repeating talking points. The main gap is the lack of scenario/sensitivity analysis despite references to additional scenarios being available externally, which limits the robustness of valuation under different operating conditions. Overall, this omission prevents an Excellent grade under the decision rules, but the report otherwise delivers strong coverage with sector-appropriate KPIs and coherent linkages.",
