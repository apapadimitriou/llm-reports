    "reasoning": "The report is generally well-structured, moving from business overview and strategy to moat, valuation, risks, and capital allocation, with clear dates and consistent terminology for the most part. Sections reference each other meaningfully: Business Strategy & Outlook mentions the Mexico IPO in 2026, which is explicitly incorporated into Fair Value and Profit Drivers; Risk and Uncertainty ties back to macro sensitivity discussed in the moat and strategy sections. However, there are notable internal inconsistencies that hinder coherence. The most material is the mismatch in the cost of equity: Economic Moat states a 10% cost of equity, while the valuation model uses 9%, with no reconciliation. Additionally, the narrative forecasts net interest income growth of 0.8% in 2025, yet the model summary shows a 2.5% increase, creating tension between assumptions and the base-case. Bulls/Bears are presented as isolated bullet points and are not reconciled with the base-case overvaluation (Price/Fair Value 1.13), particularly the bull claim that the stock is \u201cnot expensive.\u201d Despite these issues, temporal alignment is solid (stress test timing and dated analyst notes), and the broader narrative is understandable, with most cross-references consistent (efficiency ratio remaining above 60%, ROTCE around 8%). Given the mix of strengths and the unresolved contradictions, a fair grade is warranted.",
