    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is strong: the report clearly states core inputs driving the DCF and forecast tables (revenue CAGR, margin trajectory on both gross and net revenue bases, COE/WACC, tax rate, Stage II parameters, share count path), generally adjacent to the relevant forecasts. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons are provided (percentages, fiscal years, 5-year projection window, perpetuity year). Justification is partial: narrative references to scalability, cross-border normalization, and long-run electronic payment adoption provide context, but most numerical parameters (e.g., 9% COE, 8% Stage II EBI growth, 70 bps annual margin improvement) lack direct support from multi-year peer benchmarks or cited sources. Consistency is clean: figures reconcile between narrative and the model summary, and distinctions between gross vs. net revenue margins are clearly stated with no observable contradictions. Sensitivity is absent: the report does not offer quantified ranges or scenario impacts on material drivers (revenue growth, margins, COE/WACC), which hard-caps the grade at Fair despite otherwise well-structured assumptions.",
