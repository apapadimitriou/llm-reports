    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth by linking outcomes to clear mechanisms, quantifying key drivers, and incorporating scenario analysis. It explains why AbbVie can offset Humira erosion through superior efficacy and margins of next\u2011gen assets (\u201cOffsetting Humira's expected declines\u201d) and ties updated guidance to product\u2011level performance (\u201cSkyrizi (71% growth) and Rinvoq (57%)\u201d). Assumptions are explicit in the DCF and profit drivers (\u201ccost of equity 7.5%\u201d), and the analysis benchmarks where relevant (\u201cUS prices are on average roughly double\u201d), as well as using an industry average margin for tariff impacts. The report includes quantified scenarios that address policy risk: a worst\u2011case reprice to Europe (\u201c24% hit to US drug revenue\u201d) and tariff impacts (\u201c25% tariff would only amount to a 2-percentage-point\u201d), with an explicit duration assumption (\u201cdo not last after 2026\u201d). It also quantifies ongoing ESG/legal costs (\u201clegal costs at 1.5% of non-GAAP net income\u201d). Actionable implications are clear and conditional (e.g., limited exposure if cuts focus on Medicare hospital drugs; tariff headwind manageable and likely temporary). While some AbbVie\u2011specific sensitivities (e.g., ranges for Skyrizi/Rinvoq or Humira decline paths) are not stress\u2011tested in valuation terms, the combination of mechanism\u2011rich reasoning, quantified scenarios, and explicit assumptions makes the analysis decision\u2011relevant and robust.",
