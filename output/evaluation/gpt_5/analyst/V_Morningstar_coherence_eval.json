    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear narrative arc and uses consistent terminology. It opens with an Analyst Note that frames a potential stablecoin risk and explicitly ties conclusions to fair value and moat ratings. Business Strategy & Outlook then situates Visa\u2019s growth drivers and recent normalization, which flows naturally into the Economic Moat section\u2019s network-effect and scalability rationale. Fair Value and Profit Drivers connects these industry drivers to explicit assumptions (growth rates, margin trajectory, and cost of equity), and the Risk and Uncertainty section complements the Bears Say by acknowledging legal/regulatory exposure. Capital Allocation summarizes management\u2019s approach and cash returns, reinforcing the asset-light, high-ROIC story. Cross-references are strong: fair value ($306) and wide moat are repeated across sections and tables; the 9% cost of equity in the narrative matches the valuation table. Tables largely support the text: operating margin improvement (gross basis) is reflected in the margin forecast; revenue growth aligns with the stated 10%/9% cadence. Minor rough edges remain, such as a small market-cap discrepancy across tables and occasional lack of clarity between net vs gross metrics, but they do not materially disrupt coherence. Dates are consistent, with older sections clearly timestamped and no misused \u201crecent\u201d claims.",
