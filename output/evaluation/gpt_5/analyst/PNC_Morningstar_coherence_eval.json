    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure with consistent sectioning (Analyst Note, Strategy/Outlook, Moat, Valuation, Risks, Capital Allocation), and many themes are carried through coherently. For instance, tariff-related uncertainty shows up in analyst notes and is explicitly reflected in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section\u2019s fee growth assumptions. Dates are generally precise, and the 29 Jun 2025 stress test discussion aligns with the stated timeline. Terminology is used correctly throughout (NII, efficiency ratio, cost of equity), and transitions within longer narrative sections are mostly smooth, explaining why the next idea follows. However, there are notable internal inconsistencies that prevent a higher grade. The valuation narrative expects normalized return on tangible common equity around 16.5%, while the Operating Performance table forecasts materially lower returns through 2029, without reconciliation. The DCF summary also lists zero present values in all stages yet provides a positive equity value, which is internally inconsistent. There is a mild tension between expense growth guidance in various notes versus the base-case model, not fully resolved. Despite these issues, cross-linkages among strategy, moat, valuation, and risks are present, and temporal claims appear accurate, making the report understandable with some effort.",
