    "reasoning": "The report presents a largely cohesive narrative: Business Strategy & Outlook, Moat, Risks, Capital Allocation, and Fair Value sections consistently emphasize the Humira decline and the offsetting growth from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and these themes are echoed in Analyst Notes and the valuation discussion. Transitions are generally clear (e.g., Humira erosion \u2192 next-gen immunology growth \u2192 margins and fair value), and terminology is used consistently (GAAP vs. adjusted metrics are usually distinguished). However, there is a material internal inconsistency between the Forecast Revisions table and the main financial model, which undercuts coherence. Specifically, the \u201cNet Income\u201d line in Forecast Revisions appears to reflect adjusted net income figures, creating a mismatch with the prior Financials table. Additionally, the narrative claim of \u201cfairly stable operating margins\u201d sits uneasily with the sharp step-up in reported operating margin from 21.1% in 2024 to 33.9% in 2025 in the Margins & Returns table; this tension is not explicitly reconciled (e.g., by attributing the change to one-time items or a switch to adjusted margins). Despite these issues, cross-references among strategy, risks, and valuation are strong, and temporal claims align with the dated tables and notes. Due to the unaddressed table labeling inconsistency, a hard cap applies.",
    "evidence": [
        "Forecast Revisions (25 Apr 2025): \u201cNet Income (USD Mil) 2025 = 21,153,\u201d which matches Adjusted Net Income in the main table, while GAAP Net Income for 2025 is 14,665\u2014labeling inconsistency.",
        "Fair Value and Profit Drivers: \u201cwe expect fairly stable operating margins,\u201d vs. Margins & Returns showing operating margin moving 21.1% (2024) to 33.9% (2025) without explicit reconciliation.",
        "Business Strategy & Outlook and Fair Value sections consistently link Humira declines to Skyrizi/Rinvoq growth, aligning with Risks and Moat discussions."
