    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains multiple company-specific, decision-relevant syntheses and at least two strong original theses. Notably, it quantifies a GLP-1 market trajectory (>$200B by 2031) with Lilly\u2019s $80B capture, ties volume growth and competitive entry to net price compression ($7,000 to $3,000 over 10 years), and embeds this into margin expectations\u2014clear mechanisms with numbers and timelines. It also offers an original thesis on orforglipron, with comparative efficacy/tolerability vs Ozempic, a $20B 2034 sales forecast, and near-term catalysts (Q3 obesity data). The margin cap (to ~46.7% by 2030) due to price competition is a quantified synthesis linked to competitive dynamics. Policy angles (Medicare coverage via overlapping indications) add a company-relevant pathway. While there is some boilerplate (wide moat, innovation platitudes), the valuation section includes novel drivers (penetration, pricing decay, patent timelines), and insights are not copied from headlines. The evidence includes explicit units, catalysts, and timelines, resulting in high decision relevance. Copied/generic content is limited, and peer-/company specificity is evident.",
