    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report reads as a cohesive, well-connected argument from strategic context through valuation and risks. Sections build logically: Business Strategy & Outlook establishes the growth drivers (Farapulse, Watchman) and competitive context; Economic Moat anchors the qualitative edge in intangible assets and switching costs; Fair Value and Profit Drivers then explicitly ties those drivers to the updated fair value and modeled margins, with clear causal links (for example, tariff headwinds tempering margin expansion). The narrative consistently cross-references assumptions and outcomes: the text\u2019s claim of operating margin peaking at 27% in 2029 matches the model (27.2%), and its \u201c11% average annual top-line growth through 2029\u201d is supported by the forecast growth trajectory and 5-year CAGR. Bulls/Bears are reconciled with the base case by acknowledging strong IP breadth while explicitly baking in cautious Acurate Neo/TAVR assumptions. Dates and temporal references are precise and aligned across Analyst Notes and the valuation as-of dates. Tables complement the story, with revenue, EPS, and margin trends reinforcing the narrative\u2019s adoption and efficiency themes. Language is clear and transitions are explicit (e.g., ADVENT data driving adoption; tariffs prompting steadier gross margin assumptions). Minor formatting quirks do not impede comprehension. Overall, assumptions, tables, and text are consistent, and the ESG/risk discussion appropriately frames downside without contradicting the base case.",
