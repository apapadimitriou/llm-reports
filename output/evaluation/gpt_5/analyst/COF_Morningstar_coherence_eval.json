    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is generally well-structured and readable, with a clear arc from business model and strategy through moat, valuation drivers, risks, and capital allocation. Language is mostly precise, and there are multiple reinforcing links across sections: Strategy/Outlook and Risk both flag elevated credit costs in 2025 with expected improvement, and Fair Value explicitly models these assumptions (provision decline and net charge-offs tapering). The Discover acquisition is consistently treated as completed by early 2025, and its strategic/valuation implications (network synergies, volume transfer) are reiterated in Fair Value and in the archive notes. However, there are a couple of unresolved internal tensions that impair coherence. Most notably, the Economic Moat section projects that the efficiency ratio should improve over time, while the valuation table and narrative forecast the efficiency ratio at roughly 56% through 2028\u20132029, which is worse than the \u2018below 55%\u2019 historical average cited. Additionally, the Analyst Notes Archive contains conflicting fair value statements within two days ($191 on Apr 21 vs $187 on Apr 23) without explanation, while the main fair value remains $187, creating confusion about the base case. Aside from these issues, transitions are smooth and terminology consistent, and dates/sources are aligned. Given the contradictions, the report remains understandable but internally noisy.",
