    "summary_reasoning": "Key modeling inputs are largely explicit and proximal to the forecasts they inform. The report states a five-year revenue CAGR (22%), margin trajectory (gross margins toward mid-80s; adjusted margins near 30% by 2030), WACC (8.9%), tax rate (21%), Stage II parameters, and projected share count (247), with values tied to the DCF summary and forward tables. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and time horizons are provided, and the fair value cross-check via 2026 EV/sales (16x) reconciles to the DCF. Internal consistency appears clean between narrative and tables (e.g., adjusted margin \u201cclosing in on 30%\u201d aligns with ~28% adjusted net margin by 2030). However, justification is only partial\u2014assumptions are motivated qualitatively (vendor consolidation, \u201cland-and-expand,\u201d secular tailwinds), but lack rigorous evidence such as multi-year peer benchmarks for margins, sources for WACC/COE, or explicit support for Stage II growth/investment rates. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis on material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal assumptions, share count), triggering a hard cap at Fair. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific with reasonable internal coherence, but limited empirical substantiation and no stress-testing prevent a higher grade.",
