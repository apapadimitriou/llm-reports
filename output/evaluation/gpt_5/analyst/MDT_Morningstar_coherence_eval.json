    "reasoning": "The report presents a largely cohesive narrative with clear sectioning (Business Strategy & Outlook \u2192 Moat \u2192 Valuation \u2192 Risks \u2192 Capital Allocation), consistent terminology, and generally smooth transitions. Strategy, moat sources (intangible assets and switching costs), and the base-case valuation are mutually reinforcing, and Risks echo Bear arguments (reimbursement, recalls) while Capital Allocation ties back to M&A discipline and pipeline investment. However, there are a few unaddressed internal mismatches that hinder full coherence. Most notably, the Fair Value and Profit Drivers text asserts operating margin peaking at 21% in fiscal 2029, while the valuation table shows 19.8% in 2029 and 20.9% in 2030, creating a direct conflict between narrative and model outputs. In addition, the same section characterizes margin expansion as \u201cgradual,\u201d yet the model depicts a sharp drop from 19.4% in 2025 to 16.3% in 2026 without explanation, which weakens the flow between assumptions and forecasts. There is also mild confusion around fair value timing: the header labels the $112 fair value \u201cas of 22 Nov 2022,\u201d while the Forecast Revisions table implies a change as of May 2025, with Analyst Notes repeatedly stating the figure is unchanged\u2014this mixed signaling is not reconciled. Despite these issues, cross-references across Bulls/Bears, Risks, and valuation are generally strong, and language is clear, keeping the report understandable with modest effort.",
