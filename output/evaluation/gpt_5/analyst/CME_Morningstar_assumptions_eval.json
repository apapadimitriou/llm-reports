    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are largely explicit and proximal to the forecasts: revenue CAGR (~3% to 2029), margin trajectory, COE/WACC, tax rate, and share count are stated with magnitudes and horizons. Specificity is solid thanks to the valuation model summary with units, multi-year forecasts, and clearly labeled parameters (COE 7.5%, WACC 7.3%, tax 23%, shares 360). Justification is partial: the narrative ties assumptions to volatility, pricing power, and product mix, but provides limited quantitative evidence from multi-year history, peers, or cited sources for parameters like WACC, Stage II growth/investment, and the margin path. Internal consistency is mostly clean, but there is a numeric contradiction between the stated operating margin target (\u201cabout 63.2% by 2028\u201d) and the table (64.5% in 2028). Sensitivity/scenario analysis is absent; no quantified ranges are shown for material levers (volume/fees, rates/interest income, margins), which caps the grade. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific, but the lack of quantified sensitivities and limited justification keep the quality at Fair.",
