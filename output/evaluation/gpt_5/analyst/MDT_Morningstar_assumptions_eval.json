    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are stated near the forecasts they inform, with clear magnitudes and horizons (e.g., 4% top-line growth through fiscal 2029; operating margin +200 bps to 21% in 2029; WACC 7.1%; tax rate 18%; Stage II EBI growth 6%; projected shares 1,286). Specificity is solid: units, timeframes, and segment-level growth (neuroscience 5%) are provided. Justification is partial: the report cites product adoptions (renal denervation, PFA), eased hospital labor constraints, and Medicare pass-through for RDN, but provides limited quantitative benchmarking to peers/history and no sourcing for WACC, tax rate, or Stage II assumptions. Consistency has a notable numeric conflict between the stated 21% operating margin peak in 2029 and the table showing 19.8% in 2029 (20.9% in 2030). Stress-testing is absent; there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios for revenue growth, margins, WACC, or tax, triggering a hard cap at Fair. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified and lack sensitivity analysis, with one contradiction.",
