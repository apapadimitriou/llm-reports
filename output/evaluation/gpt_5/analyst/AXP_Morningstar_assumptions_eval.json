    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is generally strong: key drivers are stated near the forecasts (NII CAGR, discount revenue and card fees growth, efficiency/NIM paths, credit costs, share count, and valuation inputs such as cost of equity, Stage II growth, and perpetuity year). Specificity is solid for many items, with magnitudes and time horizons (e.g., \u201cNII CAGR of 7.2% from 2024\u201329,\u201d \u201cmid-single-digit\u201d discount revenue in 2025 and \u201chigh-single-digit\u201d thereafter, efficiency ratio/NIM paths, COE 9%, Stage II growth 5%, Perpetuity Year 20). Justification is partial: the narrative cites multi-year history (recent NII growth, card acquisition, spending trends) and business mix to motivate deceleration, but offers limited benchmarking to peers or external sources and uses qualitative terms (\u201cmid/high-single-digit\u201d) without tighter quantification or evidence. Consistency is mostly clean between narrative and the model tables; model totals reconcile and valuation mechanics are transparent, though some margin terminology could benefit from clearer definition versus the efficiency ratio shown. Stress-testing is absent: there are no quantified sensitivities/scenarios on material levers (rates/NIM, discount rate/merchant fees, credit losses, or card fee growth) nor valuation impact ranges. Given the lack of quantified scenario analysis, the grade is capped at Fair despite otherwise clear, numerically specified assumptions.",
