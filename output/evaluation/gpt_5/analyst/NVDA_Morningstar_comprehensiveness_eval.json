    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report covers nearly all expected equity research sections with meaningful depth: a cover/contents page, an up-to-date Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, and an Appendix. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (data center growth, China H20 reversal, segment revenue forecasts, margin trajectory) to the fair value estimate and provides a DCF summary with key parameters. Sector-appropriate KPIs for semiconductors are present in narrative form (data center, gaming, automotive revenues; margins; ROIC), and peer context is addressed via competitor tables and ESG peer analysis. Evidence is largely internally consistent, though the Risk section dated May still reflects pre-reversal views on China, creating minor tension with the July Analyst Note. The Financials Snapshot is rich but omits some semiconductor-specific operational KPIs (units/ASP, explicit segment tables, capex detail). Scenario/sensitivity analysis is absent, and some points about CUDA/GPU advantages are repeated across sections, though generally with added context. Overall, comprehensiveness is strong, with gaps mainly in scenario analysis and certain KPIs in the snapshot.",
