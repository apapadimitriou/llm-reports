    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains multiple company-specific syntheses and at least one clear original thesis with mechanisms, numbers, and timing, outweighing a few boilerplate restatements. Notably, it links adoption of specific therapies (renal denervation, PFA, extravascular devices) to an explicit 4% top-line CAGR through FY2029, and ties a 200 bps operating margin expansion to identifiable drivers (ex-Covidien portfolio pruning, efficiency programs, higher-margin launches), with a quantified 21% FY2029 target. The announced diabetes spinoff is analyzed with an 18-month timeline and the margin-mix mechanism (lower revenue but improved consolidated gross margin), which is decision-relevant. Competitive dynamics are addressed with a thesis that Medtronic and Boston Scientific could reshape AF ablation share versus JNJ/Abbott as PFA ramps (with near-term cadence into FY2026), and reimbursement (Medicare pass-through) is incorporated into adoption expectations for renal denervation. While there are a couple of generic, industry-wide statements, there is no evidence of copying; most points add interpretive commentary beyond headlines. Peer angles, catalysts, and quantification are present, supporting high decision relevance.",
