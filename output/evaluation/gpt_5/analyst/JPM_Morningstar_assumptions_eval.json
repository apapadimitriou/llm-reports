    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key modeling levers are largely explicit and proximate to the forecasts they inform. The report states concrete inputs with magnitudes, units, and time horizons (e.g., NIM \u201c2.61% in 2025,\u201d loan growth \u201c~5% after rates decline,\u201d core fee CAGR \u201c3.3% over 10 years,\u201d expense growth \u201c4.1% in 2025, ~3% thereafter,\u201d COE, Stage II growth), and these tie to the model tables. Justification is partial: some assumptions are anchored to management guidance (expenses) or general competitive positioning and rate outlook, but most lack multi-year historical framing, peer benchmarks, or cited sources, and valuation parameters (COE 9.5%, Stage II growth 4%) are not sourced. Specificity is solid, with clear magnitudes and horizons. Internal consistency is mostly clean, though there is a minor discrepancy between the narrative COE of 9.5% and the model \u201cKey Valuation Drivers\u201d showing 9.0%; most other figures reconcile within rounding. Sensitivity/stress testing is limited to qualitative commentary (e.g., vulnerability if rates fall); there are no quantified ranges or scenario impacts for NIM, credit costs, fee normalization, or expenses. Given explicitness and specificity but weak justification and the absence of quantified sensitivities, the assumptions quality merits a Fair grade.",
