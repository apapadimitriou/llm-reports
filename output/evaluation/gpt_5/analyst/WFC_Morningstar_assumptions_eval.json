    "summary_reasoning": "The report states most key drivers near the forecasts they inform, with numerical targets for NIM, NII growth, efficiency ratio, noninterest revenue CAGR, cost of equity, Stage II growth, and share count, so explicitness is reasonable. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and timeframes (e.g., 2025\u20132027 NIM, 10-year noninterest revenue CAGR, and share count trajectory) are generally clear and tied to model tables. Justification is partial: some assumptions reference business context (asset cap removal, asset sensitivity, deposit franchise) and macro rate paths, but many core parameters (e.g., 2.5% fee CAGR, 3% Stage II net income growth, 9% COE) lack supporting evidence from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources. Internal consistency has a notable numeric contradiction between narrative NIM (compression to ~2.70% in 2025 and 2.66% in 2026) and the model table showing 2.8% (2025) and 2.7% (2026). Stress-testing is limited; while there is a quantified sector bear-case (midteens FVE decrease) in an archived note, there are no company-specific sensitivities quantifying valuation impacts across major levers (rates/NIM, credit cost, efficiency). Overall, explicit and specific inputs with a clean model layout, but modest justification and a text\u2013table inconsistency constrain the grade.",
