    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is relatively strong: the report states core inputs near the forecasts (e.g., NII growth, revenue CAGR, expense/efficiency targets, ROTCE, COE, Stage II growth), and provides detailed tables by year. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons are clear across 2025\u20132029. Justification is partial: some assumptions reference management guidance and historical/peer context, but key valuation parameters (COE 9%, Stage II growth 3%, Mexico unit valuation) lack cited sources or benchmarking. Consistency is problematic: at least two unresolved numeric conflicts exist between narrative and tables (COE 10% vs 9%; NII +0.8% vs +2.5%; efficiency ratio 63% vs ~64%\u201365%), triggering hard-cap penalties. Sensitivity/stress-testing is absent: there are no quantified ranges or scenario impacts on material drivers for Citi (only a sector-level bear-case remark), so the analysis lacks robustness. Given multiple contradictions and no quantified sensitivities, the quality of assumptions does not meet Fair or Good thresholds despite otherwise clear articulation and detailed modeling.",
