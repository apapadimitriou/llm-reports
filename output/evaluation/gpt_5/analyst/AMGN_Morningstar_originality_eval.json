    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains three clear syntheses and one original thesis, all company-specific and decision-relevant. The obesity candidate analysis links dose-escalation mechanics to tolerability (midteens vomiting vs Zepbound), monthly dosing differentiation, a 2028 launch, and quantified market outcomes ($9 billion revenue in 2034; ~5% share of a $200 billion GLP-1 market). Valuation drivers go beyond a generic DCF by integrating timing of denosumab biosimilar entry (leading to a fair value lift to $333) and margin resilience via automation/cost controls. The modeling of IRA impacts (2% and 1% US sales step-downs; product-specific negotiation headwinds) is another synthesis directly tied to Amgen\u2019s portfolio. There is some boilerplate (wide moat narrative, methodology appendix), and portions of the maritide efficacy/tolerability data are restated. However, the inclusion of explicit mechanisms, numbers, and timelines, plus peer context (Lilly\u2019s Zepbound tolerability) and near-term catalysts, raises originality above a standard recap. Decision relevance is strong for investors tracking maritide\u2019s phase 3 design, biosimilar timing, and policy headwinds, warranting a lenient Good rather than Fair.",
