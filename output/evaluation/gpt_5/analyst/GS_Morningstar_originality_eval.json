    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains at least four clear company-specific syntheses and one original thesis, all linking mechanisms, numbers, and catalysts to Goldman Sachs\u2019 trajectory. Notable syntheses include: stress-test outcomes and SCB reductions translating into excess capital returns; the GBM ecosystem dynamic (trading + investment banking) yielding consolidated ROE stability and future 15% ROE; leverage/timeline contingencies tied to principal investment winddown; and an investment banking rebound driven by dry powder plus falling rates with trading normalization and AWM monetization. The original thesis posits technology-driven bargaining power shifting toward brands, supporting a quantified path to a 30% compensation ratio, 60% efficiency by decade-end, and 490 bps margin expansion. Insights are decision-relevant, with explicit timelines (end-2026 exit of principal investments, decade-end margin targets), quantified impacts (1.5 ppt SCB drop for GS, 5% of market cap excess capital), and segment growth assumptions. While some boilerplate appears, most analysis goes beyond restating public filings, integrating mechanisms and catalysts with Goldman-specific data. Valuation drivers are novel and specific, avoiding a generic DCF.",
