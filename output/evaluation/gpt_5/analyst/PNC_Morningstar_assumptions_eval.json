    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Core drivers are stated explicitly near the forecasts (NII, fees, expenses, credit costs, efficiency, COE), with clear magnitudes and years. Specificity is solid: the report quantifies 2025\u20132026 growth rates, a target efficiency ratio, net charge-off levels, share count trajectory, and DCF inputs (COE, Stage II growth, perpetuity year). Justification is partial: some causal drivers are cited (repricing of securities/swaps, tariff uncertainty, CRE office pressure) and underwriting history in the moat section, but there is limited use of peer benchmarks or cited external sources, and parameters like 9% COE and 58% efficiency target lack evidence tie-ins. Internal consistency is mostly sound (NII and expense growth reconcile to tables), though the efficiency target of 58% conflicts with the model\u2019s forecast ratios remaining above 60% through 2029. Sensitivity/stress testing is absent: no quantified ranges or scenario impacts on NIM/NII, credit costs, efficiency, or valuation are presented for PNC. Given explicit inputs and mostly consistent tables but weak justification and no quantified sensitivities, the assumptions merit a Fair grade.",
