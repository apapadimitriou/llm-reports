    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are fairly explicit and proximal to the forecasts and valuation: the report provides concrete multi-year revenue projections, margin trajectories, and DCF parameters (WACC, COE, tax rate, Stage II growth/investment, share count). Specificity is solid for most drivers, with magnitudes, units, and horizons stated (e.g., segment midcycle growth rates; non-GAAP gross/operating margins; WACC 8.7%; long-run tax 15%). Justification is partial: margin expansion is linked to mix shift toward software/services and some end-market commentary, and tariff mitigation is attributed to management, but key valuation parameters (WACC, tax rate, Stage II growth) lack cited sources or peer/history benchmarks. Internal consistency appears clean; narrative growth views reconcile with the model table, and non-GAAP metrics are distinguished from GAAP in tables. However, the report contains no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for material drivers (e.g., revenue growth, margin, WACC), triggering a hard cap at Fair. Overall, explicitness and specificity are decent, justification is uneven, consistency is acceptable, and stress-testing is absent.",
