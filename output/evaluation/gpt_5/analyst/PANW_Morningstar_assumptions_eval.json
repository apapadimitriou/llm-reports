    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is strong: the report states core DCF inputs (WACC 9%, long-run tax 20%, Stage II parameters, perpetuity year) and key operating drivers (five-year revenue CAGR 17%, gross margin trajectory, share count) near the forecasts and in the valuation tables. Specificity is solid, with clear magnitudes, units, and time horizons (e.g., 10-year margin path, 5-year growth, Perpetuity Year 20). Consistency appears clean: narrative assumptions reconcile with the model summary tables, and fair value inputs align with the DCF summary; no unresolved numeric conflicts were found. Sensitivity/stress-testing is present but limited: a quantified bear case reduces 5-year top-line growth to 16% and yields a bear-case FVE of $159, yet there are no quantified sensitivities for WACC, margins, or tax. Justification is partial: revenue growth and margin expansion are motivated by platformization/software mix and historical margin ranges, but key valuation parameters (WACC 9%, Stage II EBI growth 12%, investment rate 30%, perpetuity year) lack peer/sourced evidence. Overall, the assumptions are well-specified and internally coherent, with some quantified downside scenario, but justification depth and sensitivity breadth could be improved.",
