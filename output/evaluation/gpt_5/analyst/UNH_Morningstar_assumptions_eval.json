    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are relatively explicit and proximate to the forecasts: the report states multi-year revenue/EPS growth through 2029, a 2025 EPS drawdown, a modeled $20 billion cash outflow, and key DCF parameters (WACC/COE, tax rate, Stage II inputs). Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and time horizons are provided (e.g., \u201cThrough 2029\u2026 revenue grows 7%,\u201d \u201c17% drop in adjusted EPS,\u201d \u201cWACC 8.3%\u201d). Internal consistency between narrative and the forecast table is generally clean (e.g., the -17% adjusted EPS is reflected; share count declines via repurchases). However, justification is only partial: growth and margin expectations are framed against management targets and qualitative regulatory context, but lack deeper evidence benchmarking to multi-year history/peers beyond the included table, and key valuation parameters (COE/WACC, Stage II rates) are not sourced. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis on material drivers (MA margins/utilization, regulatory outcomes, WACC/terminal), which hard-caps the grade. Some drivers (segment-level margin paths, capex/working capital mechanics, explicit terminal growth rate) are opaque. Overall, explicit and specific inputs with reasonable internal coherence, but weak evidence and no sensitivity work lead to a Fair rating.",
