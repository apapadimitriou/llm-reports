    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This Morningstar report covers nearly all expected sections: cover and contents, timely Analyst Notes, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, ESG, and a robust Financials snapshot with multi\u2011year history and forecasts. It also includes peer context (Alphabet, Snap, Pinterest) and a clear DCF summary tying cost of capital, growth, and margins to the $770 fair value. Depth is generally proportional: moat and valuation are well developed; capital allocation and risk/ESG are substantive; and financial tables are detailed. Evidence is integrated via tables and dated notes, but external source citations are not used in\u2011text. Redundancy is limited; AI themes recur across sections with added nuance. The main gap is sector\u2011specific KPIs in the Financials snapshot\u2014MAUs/DAUs, ARPU, ad impressions/pricing are discussed qualitatively but not tabulated alongside financials. A dedicated sensitivity/scenario section is also absent (though scenarios are noted in Analyst Notes). Under the rubric\u2019s hard cap, omission of \u22652 core sector KPIs in the Financials snapshot limits the grade to Fair.",
