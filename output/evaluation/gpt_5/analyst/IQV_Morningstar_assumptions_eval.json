    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is solid: the report states key valuation inputs in the DCF section (COE, WACC, long-run tax rate, Stage II growth/investment, projected shares) and provides detailed multi-year financial forecasts with margins and revenue paths. Specificity is strong: assumptions have clear units, magnitudes, and time horizons (e.g., 2025 revenue growth, operating margin trajectory to 2029, capex as % of sales). Consistency appears clean: the latest narrative (May 7, 2025) aligns with the forecast table (e.g., ~5% 2025 revenue growth corresponds to 16,189 vs. 15,405), and the fair value used throughout is $268. Justification is partial: revenue/margin views reference backlog, book-to-bill, AI-driven efficiency, and industry outsourcing trends, but several core parameters (WACC/COE, tax rate, Stage II settings, capex % of sales) lack ties to market data, historical company levels, or peer benchmarks. Stress-testing is absent: there are no quantified sensitivity or scenario analyses on material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC/COE, tax rate), which hard-caps the assessment at Fair. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific, mostly consistent, but only partially justified and not stress-tested.",
