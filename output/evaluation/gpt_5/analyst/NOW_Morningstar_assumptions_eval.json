    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is strong: the report states key valuation inputs and forecasts near the associated model tables (e.g., five-year revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, WACC/COE, tax rate, Stage II fade parameters, share count). Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons are provided (percentages, five-year window, Perpetuity Year 20). Justification is partial: narrative references to drivers (generative AI, upsell, retention 98%\u201399%, management 2026 subscription revenue target) support growth/margins qualitatively, but the numerical assumptions (e.g., WACC 8.8%, tax rate 20%, Stage II rates) lack cited sources, peer benchmarks, or historical quant reconciliation. Consistency is mostly clean: the DCF and forecast tables reconcile with the stated five-year revenue CAGR and margin expansion path; no clear text-table contradictions around core drivers are evident. Stress-testing is absent: there are no quantified sensitivities/scenarios for revenue growth, margin, discount rate, or terminal assumptions within the report; only single-point estimates are shown. Given explicit and specific inputs but weak evidentiary justification and no quantified sensitivities, the quality of assumptions merits a Fair grade under the stated caps.",
