    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a generally coherent narrative with a clear structure: recent Analyst Notes establish the maritide update and reaffirm the fair value; Business Strategy & Outlook and Economic Moat provide historical context and competitive positioning; Fair Value and Profit Drivers ties assumptions to the valuation; Risks and Capital Allocation round out the argument. Transitions are mostly smooth, and terminology is used consistently (e.g., maritide/maridebart cafraglutide, denosumab/Prolia/Xgeva). Cross-references are evident: the Analyst Notes\u2019 stance on maintaining the $333 fair value and 2028 maritide launch align with the valuation section\u2019s pipeline emphasis and the risk section\u2019s biosimilar headwinds. However, there are a few unresolved internal inconsistencies that cap coherence. Most notably, Otezla\u2019s patent expiry is cited as 2028 in Economic Moat but 2029 in Fair Value, and the narrative cites a 16% long-run tax assumption while the DCF inputs table shows 17%. The maritide revenue framing also shifts (probability-adjusted ~$8 billion in 2033 in Fair Value vs. a $9 billion 2034 base case in the later Analyst Note) without reconciling how this feeds the unchanged fair value. Despite these issues, the overall flow is understandable and sections reinforce each other. Absent the contradictions, the report would merit a higher grade.",
