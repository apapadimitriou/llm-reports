    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are relatively explicit and proximal, especially in the Valuation Model Summary and Key Valuation Drivers (COE, WACC, tax rate, Stage II parameters, shares). Specificity is solid for units and horizons (multi-year revenue/EPS growth, margin trajectory, perpetuity year). However, justification is weak: key parameters (WACC 8.2%, COE 9.0%, long-run tax 25%) are not tied to market data, peers, or sources, and revenue/margin recovery lacks quantitative linkage to historical or peer benchmarks. Internal consistency has a notable issue: EBITDA figures conflict between tables (2027 EBITDA -4,299 vs \u201cForecast Revisions\u201d EBITDA 3,903, which matches Adjusted EBITDA), indicating an unresolved labeling/numeric mismatch. Sensitivity analysis is present only qualitatively/partially: a single bull-case scenario (EPS CAGR ~23%, >$550 fair value) is cited, but there are no quantified ranges across multiple material drivers (WACC, margins, shares, tax) or valuation impacts. Overall, explicitness and specificity are decent, but limited justification, an internal contradiction, and minimal sensitivity keep the assessment at Fair.",
