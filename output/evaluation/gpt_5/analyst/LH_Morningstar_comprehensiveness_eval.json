    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected equity research sections: cover/contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk, Capital Allocation, financial tables, ESG, appendix/disclosures, and even a peer comparison. Depth is generally appropriate, with clear industry and regulatory context (PAMA, payer dynamics) and a robust multi-year financial snapshot and DCF model that links operating drivers (utilization, mix shift to esoteric tests, margin improvement post-CRO spinoff) to valuation. Peer context is explicitly provided. However, the Financials Snapshot omits core sector-specific KPIs for diagnostics (e.g., test volumes, price per requisition, esoteric mix) despite narrative references, triggering a hard cap. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is absent, and ESG coverage is skeletal with limited company-specific metrics. Evidence is largely internal with no in-text source citations for several material claims. Redundancy is limited; repeated themes (PAMA, utilization) add incremental context across sections. Overall comprehensiveness is solid, but KPI omissions in the snapshot and lack of scenarios and in-text citations constrain the grade.",
