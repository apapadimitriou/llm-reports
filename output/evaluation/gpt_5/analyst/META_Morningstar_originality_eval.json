    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains multiple company-specific syntheses and at least two original theses with mechanisms, quantification, and clear catalysts. It goes beyond headlines by linking WhatsApp\u2019s limited ad-targeting data and low-ARPU geographies to a slower monetization ramp, and by explaining how Meta\u2019s auction-based ad pricing partially insulates revenue in down cycles\u2014both decision-relevant operational dynamics. Two original theses stand out: (1) the TikTok US uncertainty/ban pathway shifting users and ad budgets to Reels/Shorts, with a quantified impact (base-case FVE lift and ~20% upside if banned) and a near-term timeline (75 days); and (2) a tariff-driven macro scenario with a quantified 15% FVE downside, balanced by potential TikTok tailwinds. The Scale AI investment note adds a distinct angle on cash outflows versus cloud peers\u2019 credits, highlighting capital allocation implications. While some sections reiterate standard moat/scale themes and a conventional DCF, the report still offers several decision-relevant, Meta-specific insights with explicit causal links and numbers. Peer contrasts (Snap/YouTube) and monitoring signals (policy timelines) further bolster originality and actionability.",
