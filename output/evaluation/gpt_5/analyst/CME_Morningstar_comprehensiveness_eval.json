    "summary_reasoning": "This report covers nearly all expected sections for an exchange operator: cover and contents, analyst note/executive summary, business description, strategy and outlook, bulls/bears, economic moat, valuation and profit drivers, risk and uncertainty, capital allocation, ESG, peer benchmarking, and a detailed multi-year financials and valuation model. Depth is generally appropriate for the sector, with sector-relevant drivers discussed (ADV trends, average rate per contract, data revenue, interest on client collateral) and an explicit link from operating drivers to the fair value (growth, margin trajectory, cost of equity/WACC). Evidence is internally consistent and supported with multiple dated analyst notes and model tables; peer context is included. Redundancy is limited to the recurring point that volatility benefits CME, but each section adds context (asset classes, FMX competition, pricing mix). The key gap is that the Financials Snapshot table omits core exchange KPIs (e.g., multi-year ADV and average rate per contract, asset-class volume breakdown), even though these appear textually elsewhere. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is not provided in-report, and explicit in-text source citations are absent. Given the hard cap on missing KPIs within the snapshot, the comprehensive coverage otherwise merits a Fair rating.",
