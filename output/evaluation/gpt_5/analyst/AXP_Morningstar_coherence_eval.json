    "reasoning": "The report presents a generally coherent arc for American Express, moving from Business Description and Strategy/Outlook to Economic Moat, Valuation, Risks, and Capital Allocation. Terminology is used consistently\u2014\u201cdiscount revenue,\u201d \u201cnet interest income,\u201d and the emphasis on noninterest income (~75%) aligns with tables showing 2024 NII at 15,543 versus noninterest at 50,406 (about 24% NII). Cross-references are evident: Strategy notes decelerating net interest income growth, which is reflected in the Growth table (2025 NII growth 8.4%, tapering thereafter), and Risks emphasize travel and commercial spending sensitivity, consistent with the Fair Value section\u2019s near-term headwinds in discount revenue and weak commercial growth. However, coherence is undermined by two issues. First, the Analyst Note dated June 29, 2025 is centered on the Fed stress test for banks (Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo), which is unrelated to AXP and reads as a disjointed insert rather than a connected argument for this issuer. Second, the DCF Valuation table shows Present Value Stage I/II/Perpetuity as zero while still producing an equity value and fair value per share, an internal table-narrative inconsistency that remains unaddressed. Despite solid flow elsewhere, these issues trigger the contradiction hard cap and keep the grade at fair.",

        "DCF Valuation shows Present Value Stage I, Stage II, and Perpetuity all \u201c0,\u201d yet reports Equity Value 188,905 and Fair Value $265 (Valuation Model Summary, p. 14\u201315).",
        "Analyst Note (29 Jun 2025) focuses on Fed stress tests for banks (Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo) and overvaluation commentary, not AXP, breaking narrative cohesion for this report.",
        "Narrative claim that ~25% of revenue is NII aligns with 2024 NII 15,543 vs. noninterest 50,406 in tables (Moat/Strategy vs. Financials, p. 13)."
