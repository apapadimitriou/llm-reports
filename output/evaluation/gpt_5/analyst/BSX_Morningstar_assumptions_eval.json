    "summary_reasoning": "Key modeling inputs are largely explicit and proximate to the forecasts. Revenue growth and margin trajectories are stated in narrative and reconciled to detailed forecast tables, and core valuation parameters (cost of equity, WACC, tax rate, Stage II assumptions, share count) are disclosed in the model summary. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and time horizons are provided (e.g., \u201c11% average annual top-line growth through 2029,\u201d operating margin peaking in 2029, explicit WACC/COE/tax assumptions). Justification is partial: adoption drivers for Farapulse/Watchman and tariff impacts reference management commentary and competitive context, but there is limited evidence anchoring the chosen WACC/COE, long-run tax rate, and Stage II parameters to market data, multi-year history, or peer benchmarks. Internal consistency is mostly clean; narrative targets align with tabled margins and share count. However, the report does not present quantified sensitivities or scenario analysis on material levers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, tax), which is a hard cap. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific, with partial justification, but the lack of stress-testing keeps the grade at Fair.",
