    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear narrative arc and maintains strong internal coherence across sections and tables. It opens with a timely Analyst Note (June 16) on WhatsApp monetization, framed with \u201cWhy it matters\u201d and a succinct bottom line, then moves through Business Strategy & Outlook, Economic Moat, Valuation, Risks, and Capital Allocation in a logical sequence. Key terms (ARPU, ad loads, ROAS, wide moat) are used consistently. Cross-references are explicit: the Analyst Note states WhatsApp monetization is already embedded in growth forecasts, which aligns with the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section\u2019s emphasis on ARPU growth and regional monetization. AI investments are discussed in Moat, Risks, and Analyst Notes Archive, reinforcing the valuation assumptions and uncertainty rating. Tables substantively align with narrative claims (e.g., 2024 operating margin of 42% appears in both narrative and the model summary; Price/Fair Value of 0.89 supports the \u201cmarginally undervalued\u201d comment). Minor rough edges exist: operating margins are described as rising to 43% over five years, while the table shows 42.5% in 2029, and Bulls/Bears are presented as brief bullet lists with limited connective tissue. However, these do not rise to material contradictions, and temporal claims are consistent with the dated notes. Overall, the language is clear, transitions are mostly smooth, and sections reinforce each other.",

        "Analyst Note (16 Jun 2025): \u201cWe maintain our $770 fair value estimate\u2026 with WhatsApp monetization already baked into our growth forecasts,\u201d linking to ARPU-driven growth in Fair Value & Profit Drivers.",

        "Risk & Uncertainty (22 Jan 2025): AI and Reality Labs losses add uncertainty, consistent with the Moat section\u2019s skepticism on generative AI and the High Uncertainty rating."
