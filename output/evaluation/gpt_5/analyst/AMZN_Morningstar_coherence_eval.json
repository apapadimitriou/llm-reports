    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a cohesive narrative arc from strategy and moat to valuation, risks, and capital allocation, with consistent terminology and cross-references. The Business Strategy & Outlook clearly frames AWS and advertising as higher-margin growth engines, and this theme is reinforced in the Moat section (switching costs, network effects) and in Valuation, where segment growth assumptions (AWS 16% CAGR; advertising 17% CAGR) are tied to margin expansion. Transitions are explicit: Analyst Notes link quarterly developments (tariffs, Kuiper launch costs, AWS capacity constraints) back to the unchanged fair value and to modeled margin flatness in 2025, supporting continuity between near-term events and the base case. Numerical alignment is strong: the Valuation Model Summary shows operating margin at 10.8% in 2024 rising to 12.7% in 2029, matching the narrative\u2019s \u201capproximately 13%\u201d end-state; 2025 operating margin remains flat versus 2024, consistent with guidance commentary. Capital Allocation\u2019s emphasis on reinvestment over distributions coheres with the forecast (zero dividends) and the narrative that internal investments drive returns. Minor rounding differences (e.g., 10% vs. 9.5% revenue CAGR) do not create contradictions and are contextually explained by different measurement windows. Dates are clearly labeled per section, and prior fair value figures in older notes are chronologically consistent with the February 2025 increase. Overall, sections reinforce each other rather than reading as isolated lists, with only Bulls/Bears intentionally in bullet form.",
