    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is broadly comprehensive, with a clear cover block, contents, and all core sections present: Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, and an Appendix. Depth is proportional to a capital markets bank: the Economic Moat and Strategy sections provide detailed ecosystem and segment analysis; valuation assumptions tie directly to operating drivers (segment growth rates, efficiency ratio targets, leverage, payout). The Financials Snapshot includes multi-year actuals and forecasts plus sector KPIs (NIM, efficiency ratio, provisions, ROE/ROTCE), and capital strength (CET1, SCB) appears in Capital Allocation. Peer context is included with competitor comparisons and ESG peer analysis. Evidence is consistently referenced in-text (Dealogic, BCG, Cerulli, LPL, Sustainalytics), though sources aren\u2019t footnoted. Redundancy is minimal; the Analyst Notes Archive complements the main sections. The main gaps are the absence of scenario/sensitivity analysis and limited disclosure of some banking KPIs (e.g., NPLs/charge-offs) in the snapshot. Overall, the linkage from drivers to valuation and breadth of coverage merit a Good rating despite these omissions.",
