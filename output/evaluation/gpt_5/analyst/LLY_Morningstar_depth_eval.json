    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth with clear mechanisms, explicit assumptions, extensive quantification, and meaningful (if not exhaustive) scenario framing. Causally, it links product dynamics to profitability: \u201cMounjaro and Zepbound are supporting solid margin expansion\u201d and ties pricing power, scale, and capacity utilization to margin expansion. Assumptions are explicit and quantified across demand, pricing, and valuation: \u201cWe think US prices could fall substantially as volumes increase,\u201d \u201caverage net prices falling from roughly $7,000 annually to $3,000,\u201d \u201cWe project a 34% top-line growth rate in 2025,\u201d and DCF inputs like \u201cWACC at 7.3%, in line with the peer group.\u201d It also offers quantified scenario elements: \u201cwould result in a 24% hit to US drug revenue\u201d under EU price alignment and a \u201c2-percentage-point operating margin headwind\u201d under a 25% tariff. Inference quality is high, connecting penetration assumptions, competitor entry timing, and price compression to share and margin trajectories. The report explicitly treats uncertainty (High rating, \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d) and provides decision-relevant implications (cautious on pricing, entry of competitors, Medicare coverage pathways, and valuation maintenance). Weaknesses include limited sensitivity ranges on key drivers (e.g., GLP-1 pricing/penetration) and no quantified fair value deltas under policy scenarios. Still, the combination of mechanism-rich reasoning, benchmarked inputs, and multiple quantified scenarios makes the analysis highly actionable. Key excerpts: \u201cMounjaro and Zepbound are supporting solid margin expansion\u201d; \u201cWe think US prices could fall substantially as volumes increase\u201d; \u201caverage net prices falling from roughly $7,000 annually to $3,000\u201d; \u201cWe project a 34% top-line growth rate in 2025\u201d; \u201cwould result in a 24% hit.\u201d",
