    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains multiple company-specific syntheses rather than simple restatements. Notably, it links American Express\u2019s strategic pivot to younger cardholders and added lending features to a 26.1% net interest income CAGR (2021\u20132024), then argues for deceleration in 2025 onward\u2014quantified with Q1 2025 NII up 11%. It further synthesizes drivers for discount revenue, distinguishing 2025 mid-single-digit growth (mainly cardholder base expansion) from spending-per-card and projecting a return to high-single-digit growth in 2026+, tied to demographics. A clear mechanism is laid out for margin stability: membership rewards expense outpacing discount revenue and fixed-cost leverage being passed back to cardholders, yielding ~22% operating margin by 2029. The valuation section adds novel drivers (7.2% NII CAGR 2024\u20132029 despite falling rates due to product structure and above-industry loan growth). Decision relevance is moderate-to-high, with numbers and timelines. While there is boilerplate moat language (closed-loop network, network effects, premium cardholder base), copied/generic content does not dominate, and at least four decision-relevant syntheses are present. No strong original thesis with explicit catalysts is evident, but the quantified, company-distinct syntheses warrant a lenient \u201cGood\u201d rating.",
