    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly standard company and sector commentary with a few mild syntheses. Notable syntheses include linking the Fed\u2019s less punitive stress test results and strong capitalization to lower SCBs and potential capital return capacity (framed across the coverage, not Morgan Stanley\u2013specific) and observing two quarters of rising sweep deposits as a possible turning point for wealth managers\u2019 NII. However, the bulk of the analysis reiterates widely known themes: MS\u2019s shift to wealth management via E-Trade/Eaton Vance, trading revenue being above normal and likely to mean-revert, and Basel III proposals potentially lifting RWAs by up to 20%. The valuation section relies on conventional DCF inputs (COE 9%, margin/ROTE targets, AUM/NII CAGRs) without introducing any novel drivers or mechanisms unique to MS. Decision relevance is limited: few insights are company-distinct, quantified, or tied to explicit catalysts/timelines. With \u22653 generic restatements and no original thesis, and a valuation section lacking novel drivers, originality is capped at Fair despite the minor syntheses.",
