    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by linking forecasts to identifiable drivers and quantifying key assumptions. It provides causal explanations for margins and growth, such as cross-border recovery and client incentives affecting profitability: \u201cthe bounceback in more lucrative cross-border transactions\u201d and \u201cpartially offset by an increase in client incentives.\u201d Inference quality is supported by explicit, quantified projections (\u201cWe project gross revenue to grow at 10%.\u201d; \u201cto improve modestly from 48% in fiscal 2024\u201d), and a clear discount rate framework (\u201cWe use a 9% cost of equity.\u201d), plus detailed DCF parameters and multi-year financial forecasts. Assumptions are anchored to historical normalization (prepandemic levels) and business scalability, which serves as a benchmark to past performance, though peer benchmarking is limited. The report acknowledges uncertainty and counterpoints\u2014stablecoins and regulatory/legal risks\u2014and flags near-term macro issues (\u201ctariffs create significant near-term uncertainty going forward.\u201d), but it stops short of quantified scenario or sensitivity analyses (e.g., no ranges for client incentives or cross-border volumes). Actionable implications are present via fair value maintenance and the view of modest overvaluation, as well as monitoring stablecoin developments. Overall, explicit mechanisms and quantified assumptions elevate the analysis, but the lack of numeric sensitivities and scenario ranges prevents an excellent grade.",
