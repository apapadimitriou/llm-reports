    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected equity research sections with appropriate depth for a medical devices company: clear cover/contents, analyst notes, business description, strategy and outlook, bulls/bears, moat analysis, valuation and profit drivers, risks, capital allocation, ESG, and a detailed financials snapshot. Proportionality is strong: the narrative focuses on sector-relevant growth drivers (Farapulse, Watchman) and competitive dynamics, while the valuation section connects these drivers to explicit assumptions (revenue growth, margins) and a full DCF with WACC, tax, and Stage II parameters. Evidence integration is consistent, with multiple dated analyst notes and comprehensive tables for multi-year history and forecasts, plus peer benchmarking on valuation and ESG. Redundancy is minimal; recurring themes add incremental detail rather than repetition. Key gaps include the absence of scenario/sensitivity analysis and a missing core KPI (gross margin) in the financial snapshot tables. While qualitative references to regulatory and reimbursement context are present, in-text external source citations are not explicit. Overall, the scope is broad and cohesive, with strong linkage from operating drivers to valuation, but the lack of scenarios and a thin KPI dimension prevent an Excellent grade.",
