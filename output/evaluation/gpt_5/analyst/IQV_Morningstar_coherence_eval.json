    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a coherent, well-connected narrative from near-term performance to long-term value drivers. The Analyst Note (7 May 2025) sets the stage with macro-related proposal-to-contract delays but maintains the $268 fair value and explains why\u2014resilience from diversified segments and strong relationships\u2014while explicitly tying AI investments to expected margin expansion. This rationale is reinforced by Business Strategy & Outlook and Economic Moat sections (25 Apr 2025), which consistently define TAS and R&DS and emphasize switching costs and proprietary data, ensuring terminology and segment roles remain aligned throughout. Fair Value and Profit Drivers (22 Jul 2024) connects demand, backlog, and AI/real-world evidence to growth and margin assumptions, and the Valuation Model Summary shows operating margin rising to 20.3% by 2029, supporting the narrative of efficiency gains. Cross-section connective tissue is strong: the Forecast Revisions table directly reconciles the earlier 7 Feb 2025 outlook with updated 2025 growth (~5%), and Risks (25 Apr 2025) explicitly surface regulatory/privacy dependencies that echo Bears Say, thereby resolving potential tensions. Minor dated phrasing (\u201cWe forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2023\u201d) and a small formatting glitch do not materially disrupt flow. Overall, tables and text align on backlog, book-to-bill, margin trajectory, capital allocation (buybacks, no dividend), and uncertainty, yielding a smooth, internally consistent argument.",

        "Analyst Note (7 May 2025): AI agents reduce delivery time by two-thirds and costs by 30%; narrative anticipates margin expansion, consistent with Operating Margin rising to 20.3% by 2029 in the Valuation Model Summary.",
        "Forecast Revisions (as of 7 May 2025): 2025 revenue updated to 16,189 (from 15,965), aligning with the Analyst Note\u2019s ~5% growth forecast and maintaining the $268 fair value.",
        "Risks (25 Apr 2025) on regulatory dependence for real-world evidence and data privacy changes explicitly echo Bears Say (22 Jul 2024), tying risk factors back to the base-case."
