    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a cohesive narrative that connects near-term end-market softness to a well-supported base-case valuation and longer-term moat-based advantages. Business Strategy & Outlook clearly sets expectations for a constrained 2025 and normalization in 2026, and this is echoed in Fair Value and Profit Drivers and in the model\u2019s revenue growth path (muted in 2025, mid-single-digit thereafter). Assumptions and terminology are used consistently: the cost of capital cited in the narrative (7%) matches the valuation model\u2019s WACC, and the focus on consumables and services recurring revenue aligns with the moat discussion of switching costs and stickiness. Bulls/Bears themes (tariffs, China, academic demand) are reflected in Risk and Uncertainty and are reconciled with margin resilience and pricing power in the base case. The Capital Allocation section\u2019s leverage trajectory is supported by the financial leverage table, and its critique of dividends aligns with the payout ratios shown. Dates are explicit and internally consistent across sections and figures, with fair value reiterated and supported by the DCF summary. Minor typographical issues do not impede flow. Overall, transitions are logical, sections reference each other implicitly through shared assumptions and quantified forecasts, and no material contradictions between narrative and tables are evident.",
