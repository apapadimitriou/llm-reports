    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is reasonably strong: the report states core inputs driving the DCF and forecasts (revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, WACC/COE, tax rate, share count, Stage II growth/investment) and places them near the valuation tables. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons are given (e.g., five-year sales CAGR, operating margin target, 9.0% COE, 8.9% WACC, 19% tax). Justification is partial: the narrative cites ARPU history (2018\u20132023) and regional monetization drivers and efficiency gains, but most parameters (e.g., WACC/COE, margin target) lack cited sources, peer benchmarks, or multi-year reconciliations. Consistency has a material issue: text calls for \u201coperating margins rising to 43%,\u201d while the forecast table peaks at 42.5% by 2029; this unresolved text\u2013table mismatch forces caution. Sensitivity is present but limited: two quantified scenario references (\u221215% FVE on tariffs, +20% FVE on a US TikTok ban) indicate valuation impact, yet there is no systematic sensitivity across major levers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, tax). Overall, the assumptions are listed and specific, but with weak justification and a contradiction plus limited quantified sensitivities, warranting a Fair grade.",
