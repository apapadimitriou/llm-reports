    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "This 21-page Morningstar report is broadly comprehensive. It includes a clear cover block and contents, an analyst note/executive-style outlook, detailed business description with segment mix, strategy and end-market commentary, bulls/bears, competitive positioning via an Economic Moat, valuation with explicit profit drivers and DCF assumptions (growth, margin trajectory, WACC, tax rate), risks/uncertainty, capital allocation, peer benchmarking, ESG risk metrics, and an appendix/methodology. The Financials Snapshot is robust, presenting multi-year actuals and forecasts for revenue, EPS (adjusted and GAAP), margins, ROIC/ROE/ROA, leverage, and valuation multiples. Sector-relevant details such as recurring revenue mix (82%) and organic growth anecdotes by segment appear in the narrative, which helps proportional depth. Evidence integration is consistent with internal Morningstar models and Sustainalytics ESG data; peers are contextualized with fair values and ratios. Redundancy is minimal, with earnings notes adding incremental context rather than repeating earlier sections. The main gap is the absence of displayed scenario/sensitivity analysis and limited tabular sector KPIs like bookings/backlog (particularly for CRO). In-text external source citations are sparse, but claims are anchored to the firm\u2019s analytics and disclosed methodologies. Overall, the missing scenarios modestly constrain comprehensiveness, but linkage from operating drivers to valuation is clear, supporting a Good rating.",
