    "summary_reasoning": "This is a well-structured report with a complete cover block and contents, clear Analyst Notes, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, and a detailed multi-year Financials Snapshot. The valuation section explicitly ties operating drivers (product peak sales, LOEs, IRA impacts, PoS for maridebart cafraglutide) to the fair value via a DCF with stated WACC, tax, share count, and PV by stage, which is a strong linkage. Peer context is included with competitor comparisons. Evidence is consistently dated and internally sourced, and sector context is discussed throughout. However, the Financials Snapshot lacks key biopharma-specific KPI tables (e.g., product-level revenue forecasts, pipeline/milestone table, R&D as % of sales), which triggers the KPI hard cap. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is not shown in-report. There are minor internal inconsistencies (e.g., long-run tax rate 16% in text vs 17% in the DCF table; Otezla LOE 2028 vs 2029 elsewhere). Despite these gaps, redundancy is limited and most core sections have reasonable depth, with product and pipeline drivers woven into valuation and risk. The missing snapshot KPIs and absence of scenarios cap the grade at Fair.",
