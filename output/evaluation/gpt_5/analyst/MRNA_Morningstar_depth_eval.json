    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates strong analytical depth through clear causal links, explicit assumptions, quantified forecasts, and decision-relevant implications. Causally, it ties product efficacy and regulatory/political shifts to revenue outlooks and valuation changes (for example, the FDA climate and market competition driving a lower FVE). Inference quality is robust: forecasts are anchored to explicit drivers and probabilities across programs, including covid durability, flu/combo uptake, oncology PoS, and margin trajectory. It also benchmarks assumptions (efficacy versus high-dose flu vaccines, WACC versus peers, influenza market size, manufacturing lead times). Quantification is widespread, covering program-level probabilities, revenue builds to 2034, margin milestones, WACC, and cash runway. Uncertainty is addressed both qualitatively and quantitatively (Very High uncertainty, probability of litigation, modeled vaccine hesitancy impact), and scenario framing appears via explicit probability weightings and management guidance ranges. Actionability is present in timelines (breakeven/profitability), cash sufficiency, and near-term catalysts.
