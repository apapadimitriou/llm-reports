    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is relatively strong: the report states core drivers near the forecasts (e.g., 2025 NII growth, expense CAGR, noninterest revenue CAGR, credit losses, efficiency ratio path, COE). Specificity is solid, with magnitudes, units, and multi\u2011year horizons for several items, plus detailed forecast tables. However, justification is only partial: while there is some historical context (deposit costs, ROTE vs COE, segment mix) and references to management guidance, most key parameters (COE, terminal Stage II growth, expense and noninterest revenue CAGRs, charge\u2011off average) lack rigorous benchmarking to peers or cited external sources. Sensitivity analysis is absent; there are no quantified scenarios showing how changes in rates/NIM, credit costs, or fees impact valuation\u2014triggering a hard cap. Consistency is undermined by at least two numeric contradictions: COE is \u201c9.5%\u201d in narrative but \u201cCost of Equity % 9.0\u201d in the Key Valuation Drivers table, and NII growth is \u201caround 6.8% in 2025\u201d versus 8.0% in the table. Given multiple contradictions and no sensitivities, the assumptions quality falls to Poor despite otherwise clear, quantified inputs.",
