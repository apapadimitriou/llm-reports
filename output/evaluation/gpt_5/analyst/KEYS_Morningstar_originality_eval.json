    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains multiple company-specific syntheses with mechanisms, numbers, and timelines, alongside some generic restatements. Notably, it links orders exceeding revenue to forward growth momentum (a leading-indicator synthesis), quantifies tariffs (~$100 million, ~200 bps gross margin headwind) with a mitigation timeline (end of FY25), and ties a mix shift to software/services and subscription billing to quantified margin expansion (gross margin 65%\u219266% by FY29; operating margin 26%\u219230%). It further synthesizes 5G deal software content (up to 40%) into margin and wallet-share implications. There is at least one original, decision-relevant thesis in automotive: electronics BOM share rising toward 50% over the long term and Keysight\u2019s positioning to capture this, supported by specific capabilities. While some elements are standard (acquisition closings; AI-driven demand; portfolio breadth), the presence of several quantified, company-specific mechanisms elevates originality. Decision relevance is moderate to strong for five insights, with explicit timelines (FY25 mitigation; FY26 recovery; FY29 margin targets). Peer-comparison angles are limited and boilerplate language appears, but the valuation section includes drivers beyond a generic DCF.",
