    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is broadly well-structured, with a complete cover/contents, substantive Business Description and Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, detailed Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, and an extensive Financials Snapshot. The valuation section ties operating drivers (ratings issuance/pricing, index asset-linked fees, organic growth, margin expansion) to explicit DCF assumptions and a fair value, and peer context is provided via detailed competitor pages. Evidence integration is consistent through dated analyst notes, quantitative tables, and Sustainalytics ESG metrics; redundancy is minimal, with moat concepts expanded rather than repeated superficially. However, the Financials Snapshot, while rich in financial metrics, omits multiple core sector KPIs expected for a ratings/index/data provider (e.g., issuance volumes, ARR/NRR, AUM-linked fee/AUM metrics) in a consolidated KPI view. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is absent. These gaps limit comprehensiveness under the stated decision rules, capping the grade at Fair despite strong coverage elsewhere.",
