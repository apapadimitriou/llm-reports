    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is broadly well-structured and covers most expected equity research sections: cover and contents, analyst notes, business description, strategy and outlook, bulls/bears, competitive moat, valuation and profit drivers, risks and uncertainty, capital allocation, ESG, and a detailed financials snapshot with multi-year history and forecasts. It also provides peer context via competitor comparisons and includes a bear-case valuation scenario, plus a DCF summary with key drivers (WACC, tax rate, Stage II assumptions). Depth is reasonable across moat, strategy, and capital allocation, and the valuation section ties revenue CAGR and margin expansion to fair value. Evidence is largely internally sourced (Morningstar and Sustainalytics) with consistent time stamps; however, external in-text citations are limited. The main gap is the absence of core sector-specific KPIs in the Financials Snapshot (e.g., ARR, NRR, billings, RPO), which are material for a cybersecurity/software name. While platformization and ARR are discussed in analyst notes, they are not tabulated in the snapshot. Redundancy is minimal; recurring themes (vendor consolidation) typically add new data points. Due to the hard cap on missing sector KPIs in the snapshot, the comprehensiveness is constrained to Fair despite otherwise strong coverage.",
