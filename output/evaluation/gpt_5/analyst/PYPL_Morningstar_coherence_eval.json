    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear narrative arc: the Analyst Note summarizes current-quarter results and reiterates the long-term pivot to profitable growth; Business Strategy & Outlook frames the competitive context; Economic Moat and Risk & Uncertainty provide structural analysis; and Fair Value & Profit Drivers ties assumptions to the valuation. Language is generally clear, with logical transitions (e.g., acknowledging near-term revenue compression from culling unprofitable Braintree business as a trade-off for long-term margin strength). Key terms like \u201ctransaction margin dollars\u201d are defined and used consistently across sections, and cross-references are explicit\u2014margin scalability and the focus on profitable volume recur in Analyst Notes and valuation assumptions. Dates and temporal references are aligned, and the fair value change from $104 to $94 is consistently explained and carried through. However, there are internal inconsistencies between tables and narrative that constrain coherence. The DCF summary reports Equity Value of 90,704 and Projected Diluted Shares of 983, which implies about $92.3 per share, yet the stated Fair Value per Share is $94.00. Additionally, the text claims a five-year revenue CAGR of 6%, while the table shows 5.5%. These mismatches force the reader to reconcile figures and constitute unaddressed contradictions, triggering the hard cap at fair per the guardrails. Bulls/Bears are adequately reconciled with the base-case valuation and risk posture.",
