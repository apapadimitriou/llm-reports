    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates mechanism-rich reasoning that ties policy changes, product cadence, and customer behavior to explicit, quantified forecasts and valuation. It explains why outcomes occur\u2014linking Cuda switching costs and policy reversal to pricing power and margins\u2014and grounds inferences in drivers like hyperscaler capex and supply constraints. Key assumptions are explicit and numerically detailed across segments, margins, and DCF inputs (for example, \u201cWeighted Average Cost of Capital % 9.0\u201d). The model incorporates quantified impacts from the China H20 policy reversal (\u201cWe are reinserting $5 billion of revenue\u201d, \u201cabout $30 billion into fiscal 2027\u201d), detailed DC growth trajectories, and a modeled pause (\u201cwe model only 2% growth in fiscal 2029\u201d), as well as a counterfactual quantification (\u201cGrowth would have been 14% sequentially\u201d). Assumptions are benchmarked to management guidance and broader cloud growth rates, and uncertainty is treated directly via a Very High rating and geopolitical risks. Actionable implications follow from the fair value change and conditional dominance thesis in China (\u201cChina revenue is greater than our pre-ban expectations\u201d), with specific quarterly and annual revenue/margin impacts that investors can map to scenarios. Overall, it meets the bar for quantified scenarios, explicit drivers, and decision-relevant takeaways.",
