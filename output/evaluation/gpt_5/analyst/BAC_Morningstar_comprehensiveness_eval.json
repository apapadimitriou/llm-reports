    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, with a full cover block and contents, timely Analyst Notes, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, a thorough Economic Moat analysis, and clear sections on Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, and an extensive appendix/methodology. The Financials Snapshot provides multi-year history and detailed forecasts including bank-appropriate KPIs such as NII, NIM, efficiency ratio, provisions as a % of loans, ROA/ROE, and ROTE, complemented by explicit peer benchmarking across major money-center banks. Valuation is well linked to operating drivers (NII/NIM trajectory, fee normalization, expense CAGR, credit costs), with an explicit fair value and a DCF framework. Evidence integration is consistent, with in-text references (e.g., Dealogic for IB share; Sustainalytics for ESG) and dated tables/assumptions throughout. Redundancy is limited; sections build on each other with distinct depth. The main gaps are the absence of a dedicated scenario/sensitivity analysis within BAC\u2019s valuation and the omission of CET1 in the KPI table, plus a minor internal inconsistency on cost of equity (9.5% in text vs 9.0% in the key drivers table). Given the breadth and depth across sections and strong peer context, overall comprehensiveness is excellent, notwithstanding these modest gaps.",
