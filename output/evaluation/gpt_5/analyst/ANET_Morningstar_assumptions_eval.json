    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s core modeling assumptions are generally explicit and proximate to the forecasts they drive, with clear magnitudes and horizons (e.g., multi-year CAGRs, margin bands, WACC, tax rate). Specificity is solid: revenue growth rates by segment, non-GAAP margin ranges, share count trajectory, and key DCF parameters (COE/WACC, Stage II growth, investment rate, perpetuity year) are quantified and tied to the valuation tables. Justification is partial: the narrative links assumptions to AI-driven demand, market share gains, and software advantages, but provides limited quantitative benchmarking to multi-year history or peers and few cited external sources for parameters like WACC, long-run tax rate, or Stage II settings. Internal consistency appears clean; the explicit model tables reconcile with the stated growth and profitability trajectory, and no clear numeric contradictions are evident. However, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis on material drivers (revenue growth/NIM-like pricing power, margins, WACC/COE, terminal assumptions), which hard-caps the grade at Fair. Overall, the assumptions are well-specified and traceable, but they would benefit from evidence-based justification and robust, quantified sensitivities to move into Good/Excellent.",
