    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: cover/contents, a timely Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, and an extensive Financials Snapshot with multi-year history and forecasts. Depth is generally proportional, with solid segment discussion, clear moat rationale, and a detailed valuation framework including DCF inputs (WACC, tax rate, stage assumptions) and explicit linkage from operating drivers (growth, pricing, upsell, margins) to the fair value. Peer context is present via competitor comparisons. Evidence integration relies on internal tables and dated analyst notes; while not externally cited, the data is consistent across sections. Redundancy is minimal given each section adds context. The main gap is the Financials Snapshot\u2019s omission of core SaaS KPIs (e.g., ARR levels, net dollar retention, churn/subscriber metrics), despite ARR being referenced narratively. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is also absent. These omissions constrain comprehensiveness under the hard caps; otherwise, coverage is strong.",
