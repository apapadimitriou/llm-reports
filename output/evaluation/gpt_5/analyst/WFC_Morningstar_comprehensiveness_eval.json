    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is broadly comprehensive, covering all core sections expected in equity research for a diversified bank: an Analyst Note, Business Description, detailed Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG/Controversies, and an Appendix/methodology. Depth is proportional and bank-appropriate, with sector KPIs integrated into both narrative and tables, including NII, NIM, provisions, efficiency ratio, ROE/ROA/ROTE, and multi-year forecasts. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (asset cap removal, NIM trajectory, expense cuts, terminal ROTE vs COE) to the fair value, and includes a DCF summary. Peer context is present via competitor comparisons and ESG peer analysis, and industry/regulatory context is discussed (Fed stress tests, Basel III, asset cap history). Sourcing is reasonably consistent for external references (Dealogic, Bloomberg, Sustainalytics), and evidence is used without superficial repetition; recurring themes (asset cap) add new angles across sections. The main gap is the lack of scenario/sensitivity analysis; also, some granular bank KPIs (e.g., NPL ratio, allowance coverage) are not tabulated. These omissions modestly constrain comprehensiveness but, given the strong coverage elsewhere, the report merits a Good rating.",
