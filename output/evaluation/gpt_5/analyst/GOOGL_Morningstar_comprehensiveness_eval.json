    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "This 28-page Morningstar report is broadly comprehensive: it features a clear cover block and contents, timely Analyst Notes, detailed Business Description and Strategy, robust Bulls/Bears, an extensive Economic Moat section by business line, and a thorough Valuation & Profit Drivers section with explicit DCF assumptions (WACC, tax rate), segment growth drivers, and bull/bear cases plus SOTP. Risks, Capital Allocation (balance sheet, R&D, M&A constraints, buybacks/dividend), an ESG section (Sustainalytics) and a multi-year Financials Snapshot with forecasts are all present. Peer context is included via a competitors section. Evidence is internally consistent, and repetition is minimal, with each section adding depth. The key shortfall is that the Financials Snapshot is largely generic and does not tabulate core sector KPIs for internet/advertising/cloud (for example, TAC trend, paid clicks/CPC, segment revenue/margin breakdown, Cloud margin trajectory). While some KPIs are discussed narratively (e.g., TAC 20%\u201323%, Cloud mix and growth, YouTube subs), they are not integrated into the financial tables. In-text external citations are also limited. These gaps, particularly the omission of \u22652 sector KPIs in the snapshot, constrain the grade despite otherwise strong coverage.",
