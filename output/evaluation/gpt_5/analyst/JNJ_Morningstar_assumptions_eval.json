    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report states key modeling inputs near the forecasts they inform, including DCF levers (cost of equity 7.5%, WACC 7.2%, long-run tax 19%, Stage II EBI growth 3.5%, projected shares) and business drivers (EPS growth near 4%, flat operating margins, Stelara decline, Caplyta ramp), and quantifies a 2025 tariff impact. Specificity: Assumptions are numeric with units and timeframes (multi-year revenue/EPS tables, $ impacts, 10-year horizon for Caplyta, Stage II/perpetuity year). Consistency: Narrative aligns broadly with the tables and valuation summary; model summaries reconcile across pages, with only minor phrasing tension (e.g., \u201cflat\u201d margins vs modestly rising modeled margins). Justification: Several drivers are justified qualitatively with pipeline data and industry context (tariffs, US pricing scenarios, tax-policy direction). However, some core valuation parameters (WACC, Stage II growth) lack source-based justification within the report. Sensitivity: There is partial quantified scenario context (tariff-induced margin headwind; potential US price convergence effect; tariff duration assumption), but no JNJ-specific valuation sensitivity tables or ranges for WACC/terminal growth. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific with partial evidentiary support and limited scenario quantification.",
