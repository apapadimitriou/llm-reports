    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are largely explicit and proximal to the forecasts: revenue CAGR, EPS growth, and DCF inputs (WACC, COE, tax rate, Stage II growth/investment) are stated with units and horizons. Specificity is solid, with numerical paths for revenue, margins, EPS, and share count shown in the model summary. Justification is partial: narrative ties assumptions to recent MA mispricing, PBM contract losses, and regulatory context, but core valuation parameters (WACC 7.8%, COE 9%, tax rate 25.5%) lack cited sources or peer/market benchmarks. Internal consistency is mostly clean, though the narrative \u201c3% revenue growth compounded annually through 2029\u201d conflicts with the table\u2019s five-year revenue CAGR of 2.6% and a 2028 revenue dip. Stress testing is absent: while regulatory headwinds are discussed qualitatively (low-single-digit profit impact), there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario ranges for material levers (rates/WACC, revenue, margins, PBM regulation). Given explicit inputs but limited justification and no quantified sensitivity, and one text\u2013table inconsistency, the assumptions quality fits Fair under the stated hard caps.",
