    "reasoning": "The report is generally well-structured, with clear sectioning (Analyst Note, Strategy/Outlook, Moat, Valuation, Risks, Capital Allocation) and a consistent narrative arc that ties Ansys, AI-driven demand, and the China regulatory context into the valuation. Transitions across sections are mostly smooth: Strategy discusses systems-level demand and Ansys, which is echoed in Moat, and carried through into Fair Value and Risks (integration risk). However, there are notable internal inconsistencies that create unresolved tension. The most evident is the conflicting share of revenue from China\u201411% in the 8 Jul 2025 Analyst Note versus approximately 15% in the 29 May 2025 Risk section\u2014without an explicit reconciliation, despite the report\u2019s own timeline. Additionally, Valuation asserts a 26x EV/adjusted EBITDA multiple, but the model page shows 2025 EV/EBITDA at 28.9x; the distinction between adjusted and reported isn't clarified. The ROIC table shows a sharp drop to 2.5% in 2024, which sits awkwardly against the wide-moat claim of durable excess returns, with no bridging explanation. Bulls/Bears are presented but not fully reconciled with the base-case (slight undervaluation tied to Ansys approval versus bears saying the market already gives full credit). Dates and citations otherwise align, and terminology is mostly consistent, but the contradictions cap the grade at fair.",
