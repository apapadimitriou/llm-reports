    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key model drivers are generally explicit and proximate to the forecasts: revenue CAGR, margin trajectory (non-GAAP), WACC/COE, tax rate, Stage II parameters, and share count are all stated with magnitudes and timeframes. Specificity is solid, with clear units (percentages, dollars, years) and annual forecast tables. However, justification is limited: revenue and margin assumptions are tied largely to management guidance and qualitative momentum (Agentforce/data cloud) and a TAM figure, with little evidence from multi-year peer benchmarks or cited sources for parameters like WACC, tax rate, or Stage II inputs. Internal consistency appears clean; GAAP vs non-GAAP margin references could cause confusion, but the measures are distinct and not contradictory, and revenue and share count reconcile to the forecast table and DCF inputs. Sensitivity/stress testing is absent\u2014no quantified ranges or scenario analysis for material drivers (revenue growth, margin, WACC), which caps the grade at Fair. Terminal growth is not explicitly disclosed (only Stage II EBI growth and investment rates), and segment-level growth or pricing/ARPU assumptions are opaque, limiting auditability.",
