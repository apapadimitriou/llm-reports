    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, with a clear cover block and contents, current Analyst Notes, and thorough sections spanning Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, and an Appendix detailing methodology and disclosures. Depth is proportional and sector-appropriate: it articulates AmEx\u2019s closed-loop network, premium card positioning, and SME offering; provides multi-year historicals and forecasts (NII, noninterest income, provisions, NIM, efficiency, ROE/ROA); and explicitly links operating drivers (loan growth deceleration, discount revenue trajectory, card fee growth, reward expense and margin stability) to the fair value, supported by a DCF summary and EPS-based context. Evidence is internally consistent, dated, and supported by tables; peer context is present via competitor metrics (Visa, Capital One) and ESG peer analysis. Redundancy is minimal\u2014topics reappear with added nuance across strategy, moat, and earnings notes. The main gap is the absence of explicit scenario/sensitivity analysis in the valuation section, but the breadth of forecasts and model summary mitigate this. Overall, the scope, KPI coverage, and linkage to valuation make the report feel complete.",
