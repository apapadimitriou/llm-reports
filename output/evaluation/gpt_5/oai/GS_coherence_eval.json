    "reasoning": "The report has a clear structure and generally smooth transitions from recent performance (Analyst Note) to strategy, moat, valuation, and risks. Terminology is consistent (e.g., CET1, moat, uncertainty), and the valuation section ties assumptions to the fair value with an explicit WACC and terminal growth. The table largely aligns with the narrative (operating margin rising from ~22% to 30% by 2029; revenue growth consistent with mid-single-digit). However, there are notable internal inconsistencies that disrupt coherence. First, Business Strategy & Outlook states \u201cmid-to-high single-digit revenue CAGRs through 2025-29,\u201d while the Fair Value and Appendix specify ~5% CAGR and the table evidences ~5%, creating an unresolved tension about growth expectations. Second, the Financials Snapshot shows 2025E EPS dropping to 37.0 from 40.5 in 2024A despite higher revenue (54.0 vs. 53.5) and a rising operating margin (22% vs. 20%), without any narrative explanation (e.g., share count, one-time charges), contradicting the stated trajectory of \u201cmodest margin improvement.\u201d These contradictions trigger an auto-downgrade under the guardrails. Minor rough edges include the juxtaposition of \u201cbeneficiary of higher-for-longer rates\u201d with Bulls\u2019 references to Fed easing; while not strictly contradictory, this rate-sensitivity angle is not reconciled. Overall, understandable with effort but internally noisy in key assumptions.",
