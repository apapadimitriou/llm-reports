    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is reasonably strong: the report lists key drivers near the valuation (revenue CAGR, gross/operating margins, tax rate, WACC, terminal growth, and share count). Specificity is also solid with magnitudes and time horizons, and a projections table that reconciles most numbers. Justification is partial: some figures are linked to filings or Reuters (e.g., 2024 gross margin, China curbs impact), but core valuation inputs (WACC 8.5%, 3% terminal growth, 15% tax rate, mid-teens operating margin) lack benchmarking to history/peers or sourced evidence. Sensitivity analysis is present but limited: it quantifies EPS impact per $1B revenue and the valuation impact from WACC/terminal growth shifts, and mentions scenario swings for China/data-center growth; it does not offer robust ranges for margins or costs. Crucially, consistency breaks: the narrative says \u201cmid-teens\u201d topline CAGR thereafter, while the table shows ~10% YoY from 2026\u20132029; and the stated P/E at fair value references \u201c~70x 2025 EPS,\u201d which contradicts the 2025 EPS in the table. With two clear numeric contradictions, the report falls to Poor per the decision rules despite otherwise explicit assumptions and partial sensitivities.",
