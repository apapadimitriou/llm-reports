    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and generally coherent narrative arc: FY2025 results lead into strategy (Falcon, module cross-sell), then valuation anchored on FY2026 guidance, with risks (July 2024 outage) and capital allocation reinforcing the base case. Cross-references are effective; for instance, management\u2019s $10B ARR target and 97% retention appear in Analyst Note, Strategy, Bulls, and Valuation, and the Financials Snapshot aligns with stated revenue and EPS figures. However, there is a material internal contradiction in Fair Value: the stated P/S of ~95\u00d7 for FY2026 conflicts with the report\u2019s own revenue and market cap figures (Revenue \u2248 $4.77B, Market Cap \u2248 $116.6B imply P/S \u2248 24\u00d7), undermining internal consistency. Citation alignment is also spotty: the \u201cPalo Alto Networks trades at ~120\u00d7 P/E\u201d assertion references a CrowdStrike MacroTrends page and does not substantively support the claim; the mention of acquiring Blumira lacks a corresponding source. Despite mostly smooth transitions and consistent terminology, these inconsistencies force the reader to reconcile key valuation points themselves. The Bulls/Bears section is reasonably reconciled with the base-case valuation (rich multiples, execution risk vs. growth assumptions), but the valuation multiple error triggers the hard cap to fair per the guardrails.",
