    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: cover/contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. Evidence is generally integrated with in-text citations to SEC filings, Reuters, and Fitch, and the valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (revenue mix, loan balances, merchant fees, margins, WACC) to fair value. Capital allocation and risk discussions are proportionate and sector-relevant. However, the Financials Snapshot omits core sector KPIs for consumer finance/banking\u2014net interest margin (NIM), credit provisions/net charge-offs, CET1, delinquency metrics, and spend volume/billed business\u2014limiting comprehensiveness. Peer benchmarking is absent (aside from brief mentions of Visa/Mastercard and ESG comparisons), and there is no scenario/sensitivity analysis. There is a notable internal inconsistency on revenue growth assumptions (7\u20138% vs. 8\u201310% in the appendix), and at least two material claims lack citations (deposit funding ~70%, Fed Category III upgrade). These gaps trigger the hard cap to Fair despite otherwise solid coverage and linkages.",
