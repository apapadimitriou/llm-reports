  "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly restated company updates and sector-generic analysis, with limited synthesis and no original theses. There are two weak syntheses: linking the raised 2025 AI-related CapEx ($64–$72B) to near-term margin pressure, and connecting elevated CapEx to a near-term FCF trough with improvement from 2026 as spend normalizes. These are plausible but standard and unquantified beyond management’s figures, lacking specific mechanisms (e.g., cost-per-inference, ad yield uplift, or unit economics for Threads/WhatsApp) and catalysts/timelines. The valuation section uses boilerplate inputs (WACC, terminal growth, margin targets) and offers no novel drivers or peer-based contrasts, triggering the Fair cap. Most other insights are restatements of public headlines (strong DAU/ad demand, regulatory headwinds, Reality Labs losses, potential debt raise) with little company-specific interpretation or actionability. Decision relevance is modest—an overvaluation call vs FVE and the near-term margin/FCF framing—but not distinctive. There is no original thesis, quantified causal pathway, or monitoring signals that would elevate originality.",
