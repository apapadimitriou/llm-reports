    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely explicit and proximate to forecasts (revenue CAGR, margin path, tax rate, WACC/COE, terminal growth, share count). Specificity is generally solid with magnitudes and horizons given. However, justification is weak: multi-year revenue CAGR, margin improvement, and capital-cost inputs are not anchored to historical trends, peer benchmarks, or cited sources beyond recent quarterly datapoints. Internal consistency is problematic: the report contains multiple unresolved numeric contradictions, notably in cost of capital (risk-free 8.5% vs 3.5%; after-tax cost of debt 5% vs ~3%; COE stated ~10% yet described as 8.5% RF + 4.5% ERP with beta 1 implying ~13%) and the margin target (23% by 2029 vs table showing 22%). Material drivers like credit costs and NII/NIM are qualitatively described but not quantified. There is no sensitivity or scenario analysis for key levers (rates/NIM, trading revenues, margins, credit costs, WACC), triggering hard caps. Given \u22652 contradictions plus no quantified sensitivities, the quality of assumptions falls to Poor under the decision rules.",
