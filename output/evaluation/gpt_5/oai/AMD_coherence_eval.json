    "reasoning": "The report is generally well-structured with a clear arc from current performance (Analyst Note) to strategy, moat, valuation, risks, and capital allocation. Language is clear and sections mostly reinforce each other; the Financials Snapshot ties back to the valuation narrative, and risks reference the same regulatory and supply themes introduced earlier. However, there are notable internal inconsistencies that disrupt coherence. First, growth assumptions conflict: the Analyst Note cites \u201cmid-teens topline CAGR thereafter,\u201d while the Fair Value section and the projections table reflect ~10\u201311% growth from 2026\u20132029. Second, the stated P/E at fair value (~70x) is inconsistent with the provided 2025 EPS estimate ($1.40) and fair value ($165), which imply ~118x, undermining numerical alignment. Third, margin commentary is uneven: an 11-point drop to the \u201cmid-40%\u201d range (Analyst Note) sits uneasily with the Risk section\u2019s 43% during restrictions and the Fair Value/Appendix assumption of stabilization near 49% \u201cpost-curbs,\u201d without a clear timeline to reconcile these figures. Despite these tensions, most terminology is consistent, dates align, and citations broadly match claims. Bulls/Bears, risks, and valuation are thematically connected, but the unresolved contradictions on growth and valuation metrics cap coherence. Two sections (Bulls/Bears, Risks) read as bullet lists with limited connective tissue, adding minor choppiness.",
    "evidence": [
        "Growth mismatch: Analyst Note says \u201cassume continued mid-teens topline CAGR thereafter,\u201d while Fair Value models \u201c~10% average annual revenue growth,\u201d and the table shows ~10\u201311% for 2026\u20132029.",
        "Valuation inconsistency: Fair Value states \u201cP/E ~70x 2025 EPS,\u201d but with 2025E EPS $1.40 and fair value $165, implied P/E is ~118x.",
        "Margins are variably described as mid-40% (Analyst Note), ~43% during restrictions (Risk), and stabilizing near 49% post-curbs (Fair Value/Appendix) without clear reconciliation."
