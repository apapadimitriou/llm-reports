    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates multiple causal links and explicit, quantified assumptions, but lacks benchmarking of core inputs and any quantified sensitivities or scenarios. Causality is clear in places: \u201con lower provisions and cost cuts\u201d and \u201cNII fell 6% amid rate cuts,\u201d and the asset cap removal is tied to growth (\u201callowing the bank to pursue growth\u201d). Forecasts are anchored to mechanisms (deposit costs easing, fee diversification), and key inputs are stated: \u201cWe assume NII growth resumes modestly,\u201d \u201cWe use a WACC of ~9\u201310%,\u201d and margin expansion (\u201coperating margins gradually improve\u201d). Data use is extensive with revenue, margin, EPS paths and valuation multiples, but assumptions such as terminal growth and revenue CAGR are not benchmarked to peers, historical ranges, or external rate/loan growth norms. Counterpoints are mentioned without quantification (\u201cEPS could exceed our base case\u201d), and there is no rate, credit, or buyback sensitivity analysis. Actionable elements exist (fair value vs. price, catalysts post-cap lift), yet decision-relevant implications are not expressed conditionally with ranges or thresholds. Overall, strong description and quantification, but limited inference quality and uncertainty treatment keep analytical depth at Fair.\n\nExcerpts: \u201con lower provisions and cost cuts\u201d; \u201cNII fell 6% amid rate cuts\u201d; \u201callowing the bank to pursue growth\u201d; \u201cWe assume NII growth resumes modestly\u201d; \u201cWe use a WACC of ~9\u201310%\u201d; \u201cEPS could exceed our base case\u201d.",
