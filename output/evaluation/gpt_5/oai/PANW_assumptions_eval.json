    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are mostly explicit and proximate to the forecasts (revenue, margins, WACC, terminal growth) with clear magnitudes, ranges, and horizons. Specificity is solid: the report quantifies revenue growth paths, margin levels, cost of capital parameters, terminal growth, tax rate, and share count. Justification is partial: FY2025 revenue growth ties to company guidance and gross margin to historical SEC figures, but the multi-year slowing growth, operating margin expansion to 15%, WACC/COE inputs, terminal growth, and share count lack peer/industry or sourced support. Internal consistency has a notable contradiction: WACC/COE/beta are inconsistent between sections (beta ~1.2 vs ~1.1; COE ~10% vs implied ~11.1% from Rf/ERP; WACC 9% despite \u201cno debt\u201d), triggering a cap at Fair. Stress-testing is limited: only a single quantified sensitivity on WACC (+0.5%) with a broad 5\u201310% FVE impact and an unquantified \u201cslower growth\u201d case; no scenarios for revenue, margins, or subscription mix. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified and inconsistently documented for cost of capital, with minimal sensitivity analysis.",
