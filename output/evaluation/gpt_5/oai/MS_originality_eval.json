    "summary_reasoning": "The report is thorough on public data but offers limited originality. Most insights restate widely available figures (AUM, segment revenues, CET1, Fitch\u2019s diversification point) or generic mechanisms applicable to large banks (integrated model, scale, higher rates boost NII). There is one weak synthesis linking fee income, rising NII, and expense discipline to mid-single-digit revenue growth and a ~70% efficiency ratio, but it lacks company-distinct drivers (e.g., deposit beta specifics, sweep cost-of-funds, segment mix sensitivity) and quantification beyond broad ranges. The valuation section relies on standard DCF inputs (WACC ~9%, terminal growth 2%) without novel levers, triggering a cap at Fair. Catalysts (wealth flows, high interest margins) are generic and not tied to clear timelines or monitoring signals. Decision relevance is present via FVE ~$150 and 2025 EPS ~$7\u20138, yet these forecasts are not underpinned by unique, causal analysis. No original thesis or peer-specific angle is provided, keeping originality modest.",
