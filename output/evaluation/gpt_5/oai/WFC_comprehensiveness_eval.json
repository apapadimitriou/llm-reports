    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: a clear cover block and contents, an Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. Evidence integration is generally strong, with most factual statements tied to recent Reuters/FT/Sustainalytics citations, and the valuation section links operating drivers (deposit costs/NII, fee growth, expense efficiency) to explicit DCF inputs (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth) and a resulting fair value. However, proportional depth is weakened by a generic Financials Snapshot that omits core bank KPIs (e.g., NIM, efficiency ratio, provisions/charge-offs, CET1, loans/deposits growth, NII breakdown). This triggers the hard cap to Fair. Peer context exists anecdotally (JPM/BoA references, ESG score comparisons) but there is no formal peer benchmarking table. No scenario/sensitivity analysis is provided, and there are a couple of uncited, specific claims (e.g., share count reduction, \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d without CET1/LCR). Redundancy is minimal; repeated mentions of the asset cap add new angles by section. Overall, strong breadth and sourcing, but missing sector KPIs and lack of scenarios/peer benchmarking limit comprehensiveness.",
