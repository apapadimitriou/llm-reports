    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms and explicit, quantified assumptions tied to drivers of AXP\u2019s earnings and valuation. It links performance to business model advantages and macro levers (e.g., premium customer spend, rate environment, funding mix), and benchmarks forward assumptions to recent history. Examples include: \u201chave underpinned these gains\u201d (closed-loop/premium mix), \u201cexpanding deposit base and disciplined expense control\u201d (margin support), \u201cRising interest rates extend revenue on loan balances\u201d (rate sensitivity on NII), \u201cnow nearly 70% of funding\u201d (funding mix quantification), \u201cWe assume 500\u2013700 basis points in annual interest income lifts\u201d (explicit driver assumption), and \u201cWACC ~8%\u201d / \u201cTerminal growth ~3%\u201d (valuation inputs). Forecasts are tied to drivers with quantified ranges (\u201c10-15% EPS CAGR\u201d), and historical benchmarking is used (2023\u20132024 growth and margins). However, the analysis lacks quantified scenario/sensitivity work: there is no modeling of credit losses, deposit beta, or rate-path impacts on NIM/earnings, and no valuation sensitivity to WACC/terminal growth. Counterpoints are discussed qualitatively (\u201cUncertainty stems from trade policy\u201d), but without stress tests. Actionable implications are present (shares near FVE, risk of multiple compression), yet they would be stronger with conditional triggers and ranges. Overall, strong mechanisms and quantified assumptions earn a Good rating, constrained by the absence of explicit scenario and sensitivity analysis.",
