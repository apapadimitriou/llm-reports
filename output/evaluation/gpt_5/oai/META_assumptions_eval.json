    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are generally explicit and proximate to the forecasts: revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, WACC/COE, terminal growth, tax rate, share count, and 2025 CapEx are clearly stated and tied to the model. Specificity is solid, with magnitudes, units, and horizons (e.g., 2024\u20132029 revenue path, mid-cycle margin 45%, WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 4%). However, justification is only partial: the report references broad drivers (ad spend, Reels, AI) and 2024 actuals, but key valuation parameters (WACC components, COE, terminal growth, tax rate) lack cited sources or peer/market benchmarks. Internal consistency has at least one numeric contradiction: the text claims the $400 FVE \u201cimplies\u201d a 2025 forward P/E ~17\u00d7, while the table\u2019s 2025E EPS of $26 implies ~15.4\u00d7 at $400. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis on material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth, CapEx), triggering the hard cap at Fair. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified and not stress-tested, with a minor internal inconsistency.",
