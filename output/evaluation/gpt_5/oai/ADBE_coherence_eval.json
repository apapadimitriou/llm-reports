    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and generally smooth flow from results (Analyst Note) to business model, competitive positioning, valuation, and risks. Core terms (ARR, RPO, margins) are defined and used mostly consistently, and the Fair Value discussion aligns with the Financials Snapshot on revenue and margin trajectories. However, coherence is undermined by two notable inconsistencies and one temporal inaccuracy. First, growth assumptions conflict: Strategy & Outlook cites \u201cmid-single-digit CAGR in the later 2020s,\u201d and the table shows 2026\u20132029 growth rates around 4\u20135%, but the Appendix states \u201cCAGR ~8% thereafter,\u201d which is not reconciled with the model or table. Second, valuation framing in Bulls includes Morningstar\u2019s $590 fair value while the base-case fair value here is $430; the report doesn\u2019t reconcile this gap or explain why its assumptions differ, weakening narrative cohesion between Bulls and the valuation section. Additionally, the Strategy & Outlook section labels the Figma deal termination as \u201clast year\u201d while the cited source is December 2023\u2014temporally inaccurate relative to the June 2025 report date. Minor terminology slippage also appears (equating EBITDA margins to non-GAAP operating margins; calling out \u201cfree cash flow\u201d while citing operating cash flow). These issues cap the grade despite otherwise solid organization and cross-references.",

        "Strategy & Outlook: \u201cthe $20 b Figma deal was abandoned last year\u201d while the source date is Dec 18, 2023\u2014time-inaccurate for a June 2025 report.",
