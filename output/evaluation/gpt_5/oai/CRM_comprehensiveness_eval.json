    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections with clear structure: cover block & contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. Evidence integration is generally strong, with frequent in\u2011text citations to Salesforce disclosures and Reuters. The valuation section explicitly links revenue growth and margin expansion to the DCF outcome and provides implied multiples and a brief sensitivity, which is adequate. However, the Financials Snapshot table is generic (revenue, EPS, FCF, margin, ROIC) and omits core SaaS KPIs such as ARR (company\u2011level), NRR, billings, churn, and DBNRR; by decision rule, this omission caps the grade at Fair. Peer context is present qualitatively (competitors and IDC market share), but there is no peer benchmarking table or comparative metrics. Minor redundancy appears around FY26 guidance and macro caution across Analyst Note, Bears, and Risks. Overall, breadth is good, but the absence of sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot\u2014and lack of peer benchmarking/scenarios\u2014limits comprehensiveness.",
