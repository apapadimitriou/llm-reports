    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is decent: the report clearly lists core valuation inputs (growth, margin path, WACC/COE, terminal growth, share count, exit multiple) in the Fair Value and Appendix sections, proximate to the forecasts and table. Specificity is solid, with magnitudes, units, and time horizons. However, justification is weak: growth is loosely tied to management commentary, while WACC (10% with 30% COE), terminal growth (0%), and the 4.5x revenue exit multiple lack evidence from CAPM, market rates, peers, or cited sources; share count (~330m) is also unsourced. Consistency has two numeric conflicts: (i) the stated \u201cCAGR ~22% from FY2025\u20132029\u201d disagrees with the forecast table (FY2025\u20132029 revenue implies ~19% CAGR); (ii) \u201cmid-teens margin by late decade\u201d contradicts the 20% 2029 margin used in the valuation and table. Sensitivity analysis is minimal\u2014only a single quantified WACC sensitivity\u2014without scenario ranges for revenue growth, margins, or terminal assumptions. Under the decision rules, two contradictions and limited sensitivities reduce the overall quality of assumptions to Poor.",
