    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: cover block, contents, analyst note, business description, strategy, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risk, capital allocation, ESG, appendix, and sources. Valuation assumptions are explicit and reasonably linked to operating drivers (volume and fee rate), and sourcing is generally consistent across news and company filings. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic\u2014containing revenue, margins, EPS, FCF, and ROIC\u2014but omits core exchange-sector KPIs (e.g., multi-year ADV, fee per contract/RPC, open interest, segment mix), which is a critical gap and triggers a cap at Fair. Peer/industry context exists in places (FMX competition; ESG peer scores) but there is no formal peer benchmarking of operating metrics or valuation, and no scenario/sensitivity analysis. There is mild redundancy (FMX competition and cross-margining repeated across multiple sections) and a few uncited claims (e.g., 2021 Google cloud deal; shareholder protests). Overall, breadth is strong, linkage from drivers to value is present, and evidence is mostly cited, but the absence of sector KPIs in the snapshot and limited benchmarking/sensitivities reduce comprehensiveness.",
