    "summary_reasoning": "The report is heavily sourced from public filings and Morningstar, with most arguments repeating well-known themes (wide moat, secular e-commerce/cloud tailwinds, Prime/seller network, regulatory overhang). I identified two modest syntheses: tying retail efficiency gains plus mix shift (AWS/ads) to a quantified margin path (10.7% to 14\u201315% by 2029, EPS ~ $10), and linking AWS growth deceleration to consolidated profitability given its outsized operating income contribution. However, these are mainstream narratives lacking novel mechanisms, catalysts, or peer benchmarking. At least four insights are restatements (undervaluation via price/FVE, capex moderation => FCF, regulatory risk scenarios, generalized moat/tailwinds), making the analysis largely generic. The valuation section uses a standard DCF (9% CAGR, 3% terminal, ~7% WACC) without a distinctive driver or company-specific modeling angle, triggering a cap at Fair under the rubric. Decision relevance exists in a few places (quantified margin/EPS trajectory, sensitivity to AWS growth, price/FVE framing), but actionability is limited by absence of clear catalysts, monitoring signals, or differentiated peer context. No original thesis is presented.",
