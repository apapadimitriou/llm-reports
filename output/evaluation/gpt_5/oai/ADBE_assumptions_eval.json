    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is decent: the report states core DCF inputs near the valuation (revenue trajectory, non-GAAP operating margin, WACC, terminal growth, share count, tax). Specificity is solid with magnitudes, units, and timelines for FY25\u2013FY29, and a forecast table. However, justification is only partial: FY25 revenue is anchored to company guidance, but longer-term growth, margin persistence, tax rate, and WACC lack evidence from multi-year history or peer benchmarks; no sources or parameter build-up for WACC/COE are provided. Internal consistency fails: there are at least two numeric contradictions\u2014(1) revenue CAGR guidance is inconsistent across sections and with the forecast table; (2) FY29 FCF in the narrative (~$10.8b) conflicts with the table ($11.5b). Sensitivity/stress testing is absent: no quantified ranges or scenario analyses for key levers (growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth), nor valuation impacts per change. Per the hard caps, the combination of multiple contradictions and no sensitivity analysis necessarily limits the assessment to Poor despite otherwise clear inputs.",
