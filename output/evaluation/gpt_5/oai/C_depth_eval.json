    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides multiple causal links and explicit, quantified assumptions, but lacks benchmarking and quantified sensitivity analysis. It explains why recent beats occurred (\u201cThese measures should improve returns over time.\u201d; \u201caim to reduce complexity and overhead cost\u201d) and ties segment forecasts to mechanisms (\u201cCorporate banking fees are expected to grow high-single digits\u201d; \u201cTreasury & Trade Solutions should grow at mid-single digits\u201d). It uses data and explicit valuation inputs (\u201cWe discount at a WACC of ~9%\u201d; \u201cOur terminal growth is 2%.\u201d) and offers decision-relevant context (limited upside and catalysts). However, key assumptions are not benchmarked to industry norms (e.g., no deposit beta/NIM evidence, no peer margin comparisons for cost cuts), and important inconsistencies appear in cost of equity and risk-free rate across sections. Counterpoints are present but qualitative (\u201cdelayed rate cut helps margins short-term\u201d) without ranges or stress tests for rates, trading volumes, credit costs, or regulatory outcomes. Actionable implications are mentioned (catalysts, caution on execution), but they are not quantified conditionally. Under the decision rules, explicit assumptions and causal reasoning are present, yet the absence of benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis caps the analytical depth at Fair.",
