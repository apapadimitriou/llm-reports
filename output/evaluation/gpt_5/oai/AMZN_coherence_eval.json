    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a coherent, well-structured narrative from recent performance (Q1 2025) to strategy, moat, valuation, and risks. Language is clear, and transitions generally explain why each idea follows (e.g., efficiency initiatives leading to margin expansion, AWS/ad growth underpinning profitability). Cross-sectional alignment is strong: the Fair Value section\u2019s assumptions about revenue CAGR (~9%) and operating margin expansion to mid-teens are reflected in the Financials Snapshot and the Appendix. Temporal references are precise and consistent with the June 2025 report date (e.g., 2024 strikes and OSHA settlement described as recent). Bulls/Bears are reconciled with the base-case outlook, as the narrative acknowledges AWS growth deceleration while maintaining a steady long-term expansion thesis and incorporates competitive/regulatory risks in the Risk section. Tables and narrative match on key figures (2024 operating margin 10.7%; EPS rising to ~$10 by 2029; price/fair value ratio ~0.88; FCF trajectory). Minor rough edges include limited explicit linkage between Q1 surprises and model adjustments and some generic phrasing around ad growth and AWS mix effects that could be more tightly quantified. Overall, the report reads as a connected argument with consistent terminology and aligned assumptions, with only minor opportunities for deeper connective tissue to reach an excellent grade.",
