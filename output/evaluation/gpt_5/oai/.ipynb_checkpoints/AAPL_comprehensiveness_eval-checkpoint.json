    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is well-structured and covers most expected sections: cover and contents, analyst note, business description, strategy/outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation & profit drivers, risks, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, appendix/glossary, and sources. Depth is generally proportional, with a clear DCF and operating assumptions linked to drivers (services mix, margins, buybacks), and solid treatment of risks and capital allocation. However, the Financials Snapshot lacks core sector-specific KPIs for a consumer hardware/services business (e.g., iPhone units/ASP, segment revenue mix, services subscribers/ARR, installed base trends, segment gross margins). Peer benchmarking is absent and scenarios/sensitivities are not provided. Evidence is mostly cited, but citation consistency is uneven: several bracketed references (e.g., \u301024\u3011\u301045\u3011\u301069\u3011\u301070\u3011) do not map to the sources list, and some material claims are uncited or rely on outdated sources. Redundancy is limited, with most repeated themes adding new context. Due to the omission of multiple sector KPIs in the snapshot and citation inconsistencies, comprehensiveness is capped at Fair under the decision rules.",
