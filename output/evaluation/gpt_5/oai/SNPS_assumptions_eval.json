    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is strong: core inputs are clearly enumerated in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers and Appendix, including revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, tax rate, capex, WACC, terminal growth, and share count. Specificity is solid: assumptions have magnitudes, units, and time horizons (e.g., \u201c~12% from 2025\u201329,\u201d \u201ccapex ~2% of sales,\u201d \u201cterminal FCF growth 3%\u201d). Justification is partial: near-term revenue relies on company guidance and cited AI demand, but several parameters (WACC, tax rate, capex %, terminal growth, non-GAAP margin path) lack supporting evidence from history, peers, or sources, and Ansys\u2019s $2.0B revenue contribution isn\u2019t sourced. Consistency is impaired by a clear contradiction: the Investment Thesis cites \u201cDCF at 8.5% WACC,\u201d while the valuation section uses \u201c~9% WACC\u201d for the same ~$520 fair value, with no reconciliation. The GAAP vs non-GAAP margin presentation is potentially confusing but not a definitive contradiction. Sensitivity/stress-testing is limited: only one quantified risk (\u201crevenue growth impair[ed] by 5\u201310% annually\u201d) is provided; there are no scenario ranges for WACC, margin, capex, or China exposure tied to valuation. Given the contradiction and weak stress-testing, the assumptions quality warrants a Fair grade.",
