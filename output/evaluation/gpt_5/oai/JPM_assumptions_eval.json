    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is decent: the report states key drivers near the forecasts (revenue growth ~7\u20139%/\u201c~8%,\u201d operating margin ~45%, WACC 9.5% with components, terminal growth 2%, tax ~24%, and 2025 revenue/EPS). Specificity is partial-to-solid for those items (units and horizons are given), but material bank-specific levers (credit cost/provisions, NII/NIM path beyond 2025, deposit betas, share count) are unstated. Justification is partial: some inputs reference management guidance (2025 NII $95.5B) and historical data, and WACC components are listed, but there\u2019s little triangulation vs multi-year history or peers, and no evidence supporting 45% operating margin or 24% tax rate. Consistency is weak: there are at least two unresolved numeric contradictions\u2014(1) claiming \u201ctrades near book value\u201d while stating implied P/B ~1.9x, and (2) stating \u201cRevenue CAGR ~8% (2022\u201329)\u201d while the table (128.7\u2192250) implies ~10% CAGR. Sensitivity analysis is inadequate: only a single WACC sensitivity (\u00b1$20 per 100 bp) and a qualitative \u00b110\u201320% macro swing are provided; there are no quantified scenarios for NII/NIM, margins, or credit costs. Given multiple contradictions and absence of stress-testing on core banking drivers, the overall quality of assumptions is poor.",
