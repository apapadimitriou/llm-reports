    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are explicitly stated proximate to the valuation (revenue CAGR, margin path, NII growth, WACC, terminal growth) and reflected in a forecasts table. Specificity is moderate: units, magnitudes, and time horizons are provided (e.g., \u201c~18% to ~21% margins by 2029,\u201d WACC 9\u201310%, terminal growth 2%, NII growth 1\u20133%). However, justification is partial: some inputs are loosely anchored to management commentary or consensus, but most lack multi-year historical reconciliation or peer benchmarks (e.g., WACC, terminal growth, revenue CAGR). Internal consistency has a notable numeric conflict: the narrative\u2019s \u201c5\u20137% revenue CAGR (2024\u201329)\u201d vs the Financials Snapshot revenue path (~3\u20134% CAGR), triggering a cap at Fair. Stress-testing is absent: there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario analyses linking variations in rates/NII, provisions, or WACC to valuation outcomes. Important bank-specific assumptions are missing or opaque (tax rate, credit costs/provisioning path, share count trajectory under the $40B buyback). Overall, while the report lists material assumptions with some specificity, limited evidence, one contradiction, and lack of quantified sensitivity keep the assumption quality at Fair.",
