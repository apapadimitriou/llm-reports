    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are explicitly listed (Appendix and Fair Value sections) and proximate to the forecasts they inform. Specificity is solid: the report states magnitudes and horizons for revenue CAGR (~20\u201325% FY2025\u201329), operating margin expansion (~21% \u2192 ~28% by FY2029), WACC (~10%), terminal growth (3%), tax rate (22\u201323%), capex (~3\u20134% of revenue), and even embeds ARR ($10\u201315B by 2029) and FCF margin (~30%+). Justification is partial: revenue growth is anchored to management guidance and industry growth (IDC), gross margins tie to historical subscription margins, but WACC and terminal growth are asserted without evidentiary support. Internal consistency has a notable issue: the stated \u201cP/S ~95\u00d7\u201d conflicts with the report\u2019s own market cap and revenue figures. Most other figures reconcile to the Financials Snapshot. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth), triggering a hard cap at Fair. Share count/dilution assumptions are absent. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified in places and lack stress-testing, with one clear numeric contradiction.",
