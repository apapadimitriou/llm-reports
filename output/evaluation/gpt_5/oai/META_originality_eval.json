    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report relies heavily on public filings and newsflow without converting them into unique, decision-relevant insights. Most of the analysis restates headlines (Q1 beat, CapEx hike for AI, user metrics) or uses boilerplate narratives (network effects, switching costs, regulatory headwinds, TikTok competition, metaverse drag). The valuation section is a standard DCF with off-the-shelf parameters (WACC, terminal growth, mid-40s margins) and no novel driver, mechanism, or monitoring framework; its conclusion (stock modestly overvalued vs FVE) lacks a distinctive angle or catalyst. Numerical forecasts (12% revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, FCF dip then recovery) are presented without a new causal synthesis beyond generic \u201chigher CapEx \u2192 lower near-term FCF.\u201d There are no company-specific theses with explicit catalysts, timelines, or peer contrasts (e.g., deposit betas analogs aren\u2019t applicable, and there\u2019s no equivalent mechanism like ad load vs engagement trade-offs quantified). One item is essentially paraphrased from sources, and the remainder are restatements. With no clear synthesis or original thesis and zero actionable, company-distinct insights, the report fails the originality bar and triggers the poor-grade rule.",
