    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is moderate: the report states core inputs (revenue CAGR, operating margin trajectory, WACC, tax rate, terminal growth) near the valuation and forecast sections, and provides a revenue/OM path in the table. Specificity is relatively solid with numeric ranges and time horizons (e.g., 2025\u20132029 CAGR, WACC ~9\u201310%, terminal growth ~2\u20133%). However, justification is weak-to-partial: revenue growth is loosely tied to \u201cmanagement\u2019s guidance,\u201d but WACC, tax rate, and terminal growth lack evidence (no cost-of-equity build, peer or macro references, or sources). Internal consistency suffers a material contradiction: the stated 15\u201318% revenue CAGR for 2025\u20132029 conflicts with the forecast table (8,000 \u2192 13,700), which implies ~14.4% CAGR. Sensitivity/stress testing is absent; while some parameters are given as ranges, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis showing valuation or forecast impacts. Given the contradiction and lack of true sensitivities, the assumptions fall short on consistency and stress-testing despite being partially explicit and specific.",
