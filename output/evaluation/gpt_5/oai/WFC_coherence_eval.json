    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and generally smooth narrative: it opens with Q1 2025 context and the cap-lift catalyst, proceeds through strategy, bulls/bears, moat, and ties into valuation, risks, and capital allocation. Cross-references are present (e.g., the asset-cap removal threads through Strategy, Moat, Risks, and Capital Allocation), and terminology is used consistently (NII vs fee income, moat, uncertainty). However, there are material internal inconsistencies that undercut coherence. Most notably, the Fair Value section and Appendix assert a 5\u20137% (or 5\u20136%) revenue CAGR for 2024\u201329, while the Financials Snapshot table implies only ~3.6% CAGR (125.4 to 150.0), creating a direct narrative-to-table contradiction. Additionally, valuation multiples are not fully aligned: Fair Value states P/E ~7\u00d7 on 2029F at $85, yet the Appendix notes \u201cimplicit P/E\u2089 ~12\u00d7,\u201d an undefined term that appears to conflict with the earlier multiple and is not explained. Minor rough edges include citing \u201cBloomberg consensus\u201d for EPS CAGR but linking to Reuters, and inconsistent IB fee growth figures across sections without clarifying the periods (24% vs 59% QoQ). Despite otherwise solid flow and alignment across sections, these internal contradictions trigger an auto cap to fair per the rubric.",
