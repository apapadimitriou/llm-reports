    "summary_reasoning": "The report shows solid analytical depth with clear mechanisms and explicit, quantified assumptions, though sensitivity work is limited. Causality is articulated around rate exposure and scale advantages (e.g., \u201chinge on sustained high rates.\u201d), and forecasts are tied to identifiable drivers like NII, fees, and efficiency. Assumptions are stated and quantified: \u201cWe assume annual revenue growth of ~7\u20139%,\u201d \u201coperating margin ~45%,\u201d \u201cterminal growth of ~2%,\u201d and a WACC breakdown. The valuation includes multiple cross-checks (P/E, P/B, P/ROE) and a DCF, and it benchmarks the implied multiple to history (\u201cimplies ~15\u00d7 2025 EPS\u201d), with peer consistency noted. Quantification is present via detailed revenue/EPS forecasts and a WACC sensitivity (\u201cSensitivity to WACC is \u00b1$20 per 100bp.\u201d). Uncertainty and counterpoints are discussed (rate cuts, credit losses), with a broad valuation swing cited (\u201cvaluation by \u00b110\u201320% from base\u201d). However, the analysis lacks granular, driver-level sensitivity/scenario work (e.g., NII/NIM vs. rate paths, deposit betas, or credit loss ranges) and provides limited benchmarking for key operating assumptions (e.g., 45% margin vs. historical/peer data, 2% terminal growth vs. macro long-run). Actionable implications are reasonably clear (valuation near $300, implied multiples), but the absence of multiple, quantified scenarios keeps it from Excellent.",
