    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report states several core valuation drivers explicitly and near the forecasts (revenue CAGR 7\u20138% FY26\u201329, non-GAAP operating margin 34\u201335%, WACC 9%, terminal growth 2.5%, tax rate 25%, FCF conversion 30\u201332%, share count modestly declining). Specificity is generally solid with units and time horizons. Justification is partial: revenue growth is tied to management guidance and product traction; margins to scale and efficiency; WACC components are listed but lack sourcing; terminal growth and tax rate are asserted without evidence or peer/context benchmarks. Internal consistency has material issues: FCF conversion in the Financials Snapshot implies ~34% in FY26\u201329 versus the text\u2019s 30\u201332% and the Appendix\u2019s \u201c~30%,\u201d and the implied EV/Sales at fair value is given as both ~7.5\u00d7 (Analyst Note) and ~7.8\u00d7 (Fair Value section). Sensitivity analysis is minimal and generic (\u201ca 1% error\u2026 alters value by mid-single digit percentage\u201d), with no scenario bands for key levers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth). Due to multiple unresolved numeric contradictions and limited sensitivities, the quality of assumptions does not meet Good standards despite reasonable explicitness and specificity.",
