    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains extensive company description and headline recap, with most analysis restating public sources (earnings beats, premium network, narrow moat). There are a few weak syntheses: linking rising rates and a growing deposit franchise to funding costs; a modeled 10\u201315% EPS CAGR driven by \u201c500\u2013700 bps\u201d annual interest income lifts; and an estimate of $4\u20135B 2025 capital returns. However, these are not anchored in unique drivers (e.g., deposit betas, merchant discount dynamics by segment, co-brand contract changes) and lack clear catalysts or monitoring signals. The valuation section is a standard DCF (WACC, terminal growth) with no novel mechanisms; implied P/E and margin assumptions mirror consensus framing. Decision relevance is limited to the EPS growth and capital return forecasts, while other insights are generic to the sector (competition, tariffs, regulatory risk) or paraphrase filings/news. With \u22653 generic/restated items and no original thesis, originality is modest and capped at Fair.",
