    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is reasonably strong: core drivers (revenue CAGR, margin path, WACC, terminal growth, capex, tax rate, share count) are clearly stated near the DCF and forecast table. Specificity is solid, with magnitudes, units, and timeframes provided (e.g., FY2026/27 revenue levels, margin percentages, capex as % of revenue). However, justification is only partial: several parameters (WACC ~9%, terminal growth ~4%, capex 5\u20136% of revenue) lack cited sources, peer benchmarks, or historical reconciliation beyond qualitative remarks. Internal consistency is problematic: the narrative\u2019s \u201chigh-single-digit\u201d growth characterization for FY2028 conflicts with the table\u2019s ~11% increase, and the stated P/E multiples at the $125 FVE do not align with the table EPS, without an alternative \u201cadjusted\u201d EPS disclosed. Sensitivity/scenario analysis is absent; risks are discussed qualitatively, but no quantified ranges or valuation impacts are provided for material levers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth). Given the multiple contradictions and no sensitivities, the assumptions quality falls to Poor per the decision rules.",
