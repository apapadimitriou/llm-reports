    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear narrative arc (Analyst Note \u2192 Strategy/Outlook \u2192 Moat \u2192 Valuation \u2192 Risks \u2192 Capital Allocation) with consistent terminology and frequent cross-references (e.g., Moat and CUDA tying into Strategy and Bulls). Transitions within sections are generally smooth, and sources/dates align with claims (market-cap milestones, Q1 FY2025 data center mix, export-license updates). The valuation, outlook, and financials largely reinforce each other: mid-teens CAGR through FY2029, operating margins normalizing from mid-50s to mid-40s, and a DCF-driven fair value of $125 are coherently argued.\n\nHowever, there is a material internal tension between the Capital Allocation narrative and the modeling assumptions. The claim of spending \u201c~$500 billion over the next four years\u201d on U.S. supply chain conflicts with the Appendix\u2019s CapEx plus capital leases at 5\u20136% of revenue and the high, rising forecast free cash flow. This mismatch suggests the outlays assumed in the DCF are far below that headline commitment, without reconciliation. A secondary rough edge is the valuation multiples vs. EPS: the text cites 32\u00d7/26\u00d7 at $125 while the table\u2019s diluted EPS (3.50/4.20) implies ~36\u00d7/30\u00d7, with \u201cadjusted EPS\u201d not defined. These issues force the reader to resolve key assumptions themselves.\n\nOverall, the report is understandable and mostly cohesive, but the unresolved investment-spend vs. CapEx/FCF divergence caps coherence at fair.",
