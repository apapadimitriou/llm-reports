    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates clear causal reasoning linking drivers to outcomes, notably cloud and ad profitability. Examples include capacity-driven growth (\u201creaccelerate once new data center capacity comes online\u201d), buybacks\u2019 effect on EPS (\u201cshare repurchases \u2026 amplify EPS growth versus revenue growth\u201d), and free cash flow timing (\u201ccapex surge, then expanding as growth capex normalizes\u201d). Inference quality is supported by explicit, quantified assumptions in a DCF: \u201cweighted average cost of capital around 9%,\u201d \u201cterminal growth rate of ~4%,\u201d and segment-level forecasts (ad high-single-digit, cloud ~25%). The report also uses historical data to justify margin expansion and ROIC vs WACC comparisons, improving plausibility. Counterpoints are acknowledged but not quantified, e.g., \u201cscenario where conversational AI agents draw users away\u201d and regulatory risks; their potential impact on revenue/margins is not stress-tested. While quantification is strong (multi-year revenue, margins, EPS, FCF), the analysis lacks sensitivity/scenario ranges for key parameters (WACC, terminal growth, cloud growth, ad margins), limiting robustness. Actionable implications are present (undervaluation vs $237 FVE, premium multiples justified, near-term FCF compression due to capex), aiding investor decision-making. Overall, mechanism-rich reasoning and explicit assumptions warrant a Good grade, but the absence of quantified scenarios and sensitivities prevents an Excellent rating.",
