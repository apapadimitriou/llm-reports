    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a clear structure (introductory Analyst Note \u2192 strategy \u2192 moat \u2192 valuation \u2192 risks \u2192 capital allocation \u2192 financials), generally consistent terminology, and frequent cross-references that support flow (e.g., the 2024 efficiency ratio anchors both Strategy/Outlook and Valuation). Transitions within sections are mostly smooth; for example, the Analyst Note moves from Q1 results to management tone to capital strength, and Strategy/Outlook ties secular trends to segment dynamics and capital flexibility. Risks echo the Bears\u2019 concerns and link back to rate sensitivity and capital-markets cyclicality, helping coherence across sections.\n\nHowever, at least one unaddressed internal contradiction caps the grade. In Fair Value, the stated \u201cimplied forward P/E near 18\u201320\u00d7\u201d conflicts with the same section\u2019s 2025 EPS of ~$7.0 and a $150 fair value, which implies ~21.4\u00d7. Additionally, asset base figures are used inconsistently without explanation: the Analyst Note and Strategy/Outlook cite WM/IM client assets near ~$7.9T (end-2024), while the Analyst Note also presents \u201ctotal client assets under management\u201d of $6.02T as of 3/31/25\u2014without clarifying differing definitions. A smaller tension appears with CET1 ratios (15.7% vs ~15.3% standardized) across sections, again not reconciled.\n\nAside from these inconsistencies, the narrative is readable, with assumptions, margins, and the forecast table aligning well. Bulls/Bears are broadly reconciled with the base case. Due to the valuation multiple mismatch and AUM terminology inconsistency, coherence is downgraded to fair despite otherwise solid flow.",
