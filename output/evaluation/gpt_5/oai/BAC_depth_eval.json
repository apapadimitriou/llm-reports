    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by tying performance to identifiable drivers and laying out explicit, quantified valuation assumptions. Causal reasoning links NII and margins to funding and asset yields (\u201cdriven by higher yielding assets and lower deposit costs\u201d) and cost dynamics (\u201cOperating costs grow slower than revenue due to scale\u201d). Forecasts are anchored to stated inputs: \u201cNIM stabilizing around ~3.3% (slightly above historical average)\u201d and \u201cTreasury ~3.5%, equity risk premium ~5%,\u201d supporting the WACC and DCF. It quantifies forward metrics (\u201cEPS from roughly $4.0 in 2025 to ~$4.8\u201d) and flags rate risks (\u201cnet interest margins may moderate if rates decline\u201d). However, sensitivity analysis is notably absent: there is no quantified impact of rate cuts on NIM/EPS, credit costs, or capital return pace. Some mechanisms are asserted without operational detail (e.g., balance sheet \u201crepositioning\u201d and deposit cost moderation without deposit beta/mix drivers). Actionable implications are present (FVE ~$50, buybacks/dividends post-stress-test) but would benefit from ranges and scenario outcomes. Overall, explicit assumptions and causal links earn a Good grade; lack of quantified scenarios and stress tests prevents an Excellent rating. Key excerpts: \u201cdriven by higher yielding assets and lower deposit costs\u201d; \u201cnet interest margins may moderate if rates decline\u201d; \u201cOperating costs grow slower than revenue due to scale\u201d; \u201cNIM stabilizing around ~3.3% (slightly above historical average)\u201d; \u201cTreasury ~3.5%, equity risk premium ~5%\u201d; \u201cEPS from roughly $4.0 in 2025 to ~$4.8.\u201d",
