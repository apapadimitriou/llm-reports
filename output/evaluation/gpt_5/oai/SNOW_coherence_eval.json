    "reasoning": "The report is well-structured with a clear arc (results \u2192 business/strategy \u2192 valuation \u2192 risks/capital allocation) and generally smooth prose. Sections cross-reference reasonably (e.g., high retention and multi-cloud positioning appear in Strategy, Bulls, and Analyst Note; buybacks in Bears and Capital Allocation). However, several internal inconsistencies undermine coherence. First, the growth narrative and the forecast table conflict: the Fair Value section states ~20\u201325% growth with a 22% CAGR for FY2025\u20132029, yet the Financials Snapshot implies a ~19% CAGR and includes a 13.4% YoY in 2027\u2014below the stated corridor\u2014without explanation. Second, margin guidance is inconsistent: Strategy targets \u201cmid-teens by late decade,\u201d while the Fair Value model assumes 20% by 2029. Third, valuation assumptions are contradictory: the Appendix lists both a 0% perpetual growth beyond 2029 and an exit multiple (4.5x revenue), but the text does not reconcile whether the DCF uses a perpetuity or exit approach. Additionally, the WACC setup (10% WACC with 30% cost of equity and near-zero cost of debt) is incongruent with the largely net-cash capital structure described, with no rationale for the weighting. A minor terminology mismatch appears where the glossary frames capital allocation ratings as Poor/Average/Good while the report uses \u201cFair.\u201d These tensions trigger the hard cap to fair despite otherwise solid flow and sourcing.",
