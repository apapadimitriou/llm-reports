    "reasoning": "The report is well-structured with clear sections and generally smooth transitions (e.g., Analyst Note \u2192 Strategy/Outlook \u2192 Moat), and many figures in the Financials Snapshot align with the narrative (2025 revenue $13B; FCF assumptions \u224830% of revenue). However, there are material internal contradictions in the valuation discussion that undermine coherence. In the Analyst Note, the fair value of ~$370 is said to imply a \u201c~2.6\u00d7 premium to current price,\u201d which conflicts with the cover\u2019s Price/FVE of 2.6\u00d7 and the stated last close of $975, indicating the stock trades well above fair value. The Fair Value section repeats and compounds the confusion by asserting \u201c~2.6\u00d7 current price\u201d and giving inconsistent implied multiples (\u201c2.2\u00d7 EV/sales\u201d vs \u201c~8\u20139\u00d7 EV/sales\u201d), leaving the reader uncertain on the core valuation argument. Bulls/Bears are not reconciled with the base-case undervaluation; bulls claim current multiples are justified, yet the DCF implies significant overvaluation without a clear bridge. While most dates and sources appear aligned and terminology is consistent, the valuation contradictions, lack of reconciliation, and two list-like sections (Bulls/Bears and Appendix) trigger guardrails and require a downgrade. Overall, the reader must resolve key valuation inconsistencies themselves, harming coherence.",
