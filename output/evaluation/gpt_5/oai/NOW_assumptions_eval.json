    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s core assumptions are largely explicit and proximate to the forecasts (revenue growth path, margins, FCF conversion, tax rate, WACC, terminal growth) and are specified with clear magnitudes, units, and timeframes. Justification is partial: several inputs tie back to recent history (e.g., 2024 margins, FCF conversion) and management commentary, but there is limited benchmarking to peers/industry and few cited sources for parameters like tax rate. However, internal consistency is compromised by at least two numeric contradictions: the fair value\u2019s relation to current price is stated backwards, and EV/sales multiples conflict within the same section. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth), triggering a hard cap and, combined with contradictions, a Poor grade per decision rules. Assumptions around share count/dilution are missing, further weakening the model\u2019s transparency. Overall, while specificity is solid, the lack of stress-testing and contradictory figures undermine the quality of the assumptions.",
