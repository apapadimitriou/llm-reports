    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation inputs are explicit and proximate to the forecasts: revenue CAGR (~5% 2025\u201329), operating margin trajectory (22% to 30%), WACC (8.5% with Rf ~4% and ERP ~5%), terminal growth (2.0%), and tax rate (~25%). Specificity is generally solid, with magnitudes, units, and timelines stated and reflected in the Financials Snapshot. However, justification is partial: while macro/segment context and a multi-year table are provided, core parameters (WACC, terminal growth, tax rate) lack evidence ties to peers or sources beyond brief heuristics. Internal consistency has at least one contradiction: the narrative forecasts \u201cmid-to-high single-digit revenue CAGRs\u201d versus the model\u2019s \u201c~5%\u201d CAGR. Sensitivities are limited: one quantitative range for equities revenue (20\u201330% around peak) is not linked to financials or valuation impact, and other material levers (e.g., credit costs, share count/dilution) lack quantified scenarios. Given the thin evidence for discount rate/terminal growth and the absence of robust scenario analysis across major drivers, the assumptions quality is capped at Fair under the decision rules.",
