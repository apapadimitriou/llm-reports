    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and generally cohesive narrative: the Analyst Note frames recent performance and guidance; Strategy/Outlook and Moat explain advantages; Valuation ties drivers to a fair value near the current price; and Risks echo macro and regulatory concerns cited earlier. Transitions are mostly smooth, with explicit links (e.g., CFO tariff commentary informing uncertainty, cost discipline supporting margins). However, multiple internal inconsistencies undermine coherence. Growth assumptions conflict across sections: Business Strategy cites mid-single-digit revenue CAGR for 2025\u201329, while the Analyst Note and Fair Value sections assume 7\u20138%, and the Appendix states 8\u201310% through 2025E and 8% thereafter. The Financials Snapshot note says 7\u201310% revenue CAGR, adding to the mismatch. Valuation language is also inconsistent, stating the fair value implies 20\u201322x forward EPS, then later 18\u201319x at the same $290 fair value. Moreover, the narrative\u2019s 10\u201315% EPS CAGR target is not supported by the table (2024 EPS 14.0 to 2029 21.8 suggests around 9%). These unaddressed contradictions between narrative, assumptions, and the table trigger a hard cap under the rubric. Despite these issues, temporal references are accurate and most terminology is used consistently. Bulls/Bears are broadly reconciled with the base-case stance of a constructive but risk-aware view near fair value.",
