    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is well-structured and covers nearly all expected sections: cover block and contents, analyst note, business description, strategy/outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation/profit drivers, risks, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, appendix, and sources. Evidence integration is generally strong, with frequent in-text citations to press releases and third-party sources. Valuation assumptions are explicit (revenue growth, margins, tax, WACC, terminal growth) and linked to operating drivers. However, the Financials Snapshot omits core SaaS KPIs (ARR, NRR, RPO/cRPO, billings), which are material for the sector; this triggers the hard cap to Fair. Peer benchmarking is limited to narrative mentions of competitors without comparative metrics or a peer table. No scenario or sensitivity analysis is provided. Some redundancy is present (Q2 beat-and-raise and AI demand repeated across the Analyst Note, Strategy, and Bulls sections). Minor inconsistencies are noted in buyback amounts and EV/sales references, as well as phrasing around price vs fair value. Overall, the scope is broad and mostly proportionate, but the KPI omissions and lack of peer/scenario work constrain comprehensiveness.",
