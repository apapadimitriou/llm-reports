    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are stated explicitly and largely concentrated in the Fair Value and Appendix sections (revenue CAGR, NIM, operating margin, tax rate, WACC, terminal growth, share count). Specificity is generally solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons are given (e.g., 3\u20134% CAGR through 2029, NIM ~3.3%, WACC ~9%, terminal growth 2.5%, tax rate 18%, shares ~9.5B flat). Justification is partial: some assumptions reference recent NII/NIM datapoints and macro inputs, but there is limited use of multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or sourced parameters for tax rate, terminal growth, and WACC components. Internal consistency has at least one unresolved numeric contradiction: the Analyst Note cites \u201cstable 20\u201322% operating margins\u201d while the Fair Value section and table use ~22\u201323% and 22.5\u201323.0%. Sensitivity/scenario analysis is absent; risks are discussed qualitatively without quantified ranges or valuation impacts for material levers (rates/NIM, credit costs, margins). Under the hard caps, the combination of one contradiction and no quantified sensitivities results in a Poor grade despite reasonable explicitness and specificity.",
