    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s key drivers are mostly explicit and proximal to the forecasts, especially in the Appendix and the Fair Value section. Specificity is generally solid: revenue CAGR ranges, target operating margin, tax rate, share count change, WACC, and terminal growth are quantified with units and horizons. Some justification is present via recent historical revenue and margin trends (2022\u20132024) and management guidance, but several core valuation parameters (WACC ~8%, terminal growth ~3%, tax rate 25%, share count \u22121% p.a.) lack evidence or peer/market linkage. Internal consistency shows at least one numeric contradiction: the Fair Value section states a fair value implies \u201c20\u201322\u00d7 forward EPS\u201d and also \u201c~18\u201319\u00d7,\u201d without reconciliation. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for material levers (rates/NIM, credit losses, margins, revenue growth), triggering a cap at Fair per the hard rules. Assumptions about NII (\u201c500\u2013700 bps annual interest income lifts\u201d) are vague in unit intent and not tied to tables. Overall, the assumptions are clear and specific in places, modestly justified by history, but lack robust evidence and sensitivity analysis, with a noted contradiction in valuation multiples.",
