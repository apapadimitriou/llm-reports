    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are explicit and concentrated in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section and the Appendix, with proximate tables that reconcile revenue, margins, and EPS paths. Specificity is strong: magnitudes, units, and horizons are stated for core drivers (5-year revenue CAGR ~13%, FY2025 revenue $282B, margin trajectory to ~46%, WACC 8%, terminal growth 2.5%, buybacks ~$20B/year, Activision impact +3% growth and -100 bps margin). Internal consistency between narrative and the Financials Snapshot appears clean; the FY2029 revenue (~$445B) and margin (~46%) align, and EPS trajectories largely match the table. Justification is partial: some references support near-term Azure growth and financial strength (AAA rating), but key valuation inputs (WACC 8%, terminal growth 2.5%, long-term margin 46%, buyback pace) lack rigorous evidence tied to market rates, peer benchmarks, or multi-year historical analysis. Critically, the report provides no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material levers (revenue/margins, WACC, terminal growth, buybacks), triggering the hard cap at Fair. Overall, assumptions are clear and specific but weakly justified and unstress-tested.",
