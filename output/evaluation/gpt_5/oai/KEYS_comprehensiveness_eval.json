    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is well-structured and covers nearly all headline sections: cover/contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. Evidence integration is generally consistent, with frequent in-text citations for operational data (orders, backlog, EPS, cash, segment revenue) and regulatory/M&A updates. Valuation assumptions are explicit and reasonably linked to operating drivers (growth in communications/semis, mix shift to software/services, margin trajectory). However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits multiple core sector KPIs that are important for test-and-measurement hardware: multi-year orders/bookings, backlog, gross margin, R&D % of sales, and mix of recurring/software revenue. Peer benchmarking is minimal (competitors named; ESG peer scores) without comparative financials or valuation multiples, and no scenario/sensitivity analysis is provided. Some repetition exists (backlog/recurring revenue highlighted in both Analyst Note/Strategy and Bulls without added depth). Given the KPI gaps in the snapshot and absence of scenarios and robust peer benchmarking, comprehensiveness is solid at a headline level but lacks depth in key quantitative areas, warranting a Fair grade.",
