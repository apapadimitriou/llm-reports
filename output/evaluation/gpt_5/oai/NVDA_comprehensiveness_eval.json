    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is broadly well-structured and covers nearly all expected sections: cover block and contents, an evidence-backed Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers (with DCF inputs), Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. Evidence integration is generally strong, with frequent in-text citations to Reuters, AP, Morningstar, and others. Valuation assumptions explicitly reference revenue CAGR, margin trajectories, WACC, and terminal growth, and they are tied to operating drivers (data center leadership, gaming recovery). However, the Financials Snapshot lacks key semiconductor KPIs: no gross margin line, no segment revenue breakdown (Data Center vs. Gaming), no CapEx/capacity metrics, inventory, or unit/ASP data. This omission triggers the hard cap to Fair. The report also lacks peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis. Some material claims (e.g., buyback cadence, gross margin level, \u201cvirtually no net debt,\u201d and FCF magnitude) are not cited. There is minor redundancy (CUDA ecosystem/moat points and the $125 fair value repeated across sections) and a small internal inconsistency between stated P/E multiples at the $125 FVE and the provided EPS table. Overall, comprehensive in scope but capped by thin KPI tabling and absent scenarios/peer benchmarking.",
