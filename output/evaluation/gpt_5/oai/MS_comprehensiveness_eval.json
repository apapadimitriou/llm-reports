    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: cover block, contents, analyst note, business description, strategy/outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation & profit drivers, risk, capital allocation, ESG, appendix, and sources. The Analyst Note and Strategy sections integrate timely data with citations, and the risk/regulatory context is adequately addressed. Valuation includes explicit assumptions (revenue CAGR, margin, WACC, terminal growth) and ties them to drivers, with a brief sensitivity to WACC. Capital allocation and ESG are treated with reasonable depth. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits core sector KPIs for a global broker/dealer-bank (e.g., NII/NIM, loan loss provisions, CET1, efficiency ratio, AUM/NNA), triggering a hard cap to Fair. Peer benchmarking is absent, and scenario analysis beyond a single WACC sensitivity is missing. Sourcing is generally consistent, though a few material claims lack explicit citations. Redundancy is limited, with repeated efficiency/CET1 points generally adding context in separate sections. Overall, the report is well-structured and evidence-based, but the lack of sector KPIs in the snapshot and missing peer/scenario work constrain comprehensiveness.",
