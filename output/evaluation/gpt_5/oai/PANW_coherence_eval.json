    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear arc from market context and recent results through strategy, moat, valuation, risks, and financials. Many sections cross-reference consistently: the 80% subscription mix is cited in the Analyst Note, Business Description, and Moat; FY2025 guidance is linked to the valuation forecasts and the Financials Snapshot revenue of 9.15B. Margins are coherently discussed with gross margin ~74% appearing in Strategy and supported by the 10-K source. However, there are notable internal inconsistencies that disrupt coherence. In the Analyst Note, the statement that the fair value (~$180) is below the current price yet \u201cimplying modest upside\u201d is contradictory to the cover block\u2019s Price/FVE of 1.13\u00d7. Assumptions are also mismatched: the Fair Value section uses beta ~1.2 while the Appendix specifies beta ~1.1 for the same WACC framework. Terminology is occasionally sloppy\u2014\u201cFY2025 guided +14% GDP\u201d and \u201csubscription retention (>80% of sales)\u201d conflate retention with revenue mix\u2014creating noise. Capital Allocation\u2019s claim of \u201creturned cash\u2026via a 2-for-1 stock split\u201d is conceptually inconsistent, further weakening clarity. Despite these issues, the narrative generally flows, with reasonable transitions and source alignment. The contradictions trigger an auto-cap at fair per guardrails.",
