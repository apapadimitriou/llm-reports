    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report relies heavily on Reuters and SEC filings, with most analysis restating public facts (export curbs, NVIDIA share, segment trends, buybacks). I identified one weak synthesis: a simple sensitivity linking $1B revenue at ~50% GM to $0.10\u2013$0.15 EPS and noting valuation sensitivity to WACC/terminal growth. Forecast statements (mid-teens CAGR, H2\u201925 data-center pullback) are generic and lack company-specific mechanisms or catalysts beyond widely reported export restrictions. The valuation section is a standard DCF with conventional inputs (CAGR, WACC, margins) and no novel drivers (e.g., deposit betas equivalent like GPU supply cadence, MI300 yield/packaging constraints, or customer mix shifts). Decision relevance is present for some items (margin hit from curbs, fair value/EV/EBITDA), but originality is minimal: no unique theses, quantified causal links, or peer-differentiated angles. With \u22653 copied/restated insights and no strong original thesis, and a valuation lacking new mechanisms, the report fits a Fair grade under the hard caps.",
