    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains several company-specific details but offers limited original insight. Most analytical statements are restatements of public narratives (moat from S&P 500 and ratings duopoly, synergies from IHS Markit, macro sensitivity of Ratings). The valuation section provides a DCF with standard assumptions (7\u20139% revenue CAGR, 100\u2013200 bps margin expansion, ~8.5% WACC) and a fair value of $585, but it lacks novel drivers or mechanisms beyond widely discussed tailwinds (ESG, index-linked AUM, spinoff execution). There is at most one weak synthesis linking assumptions to fair value; no unique thesis with catalysts or quantification tied to decision-relevant, company-distinct angles (e.g., segment-specific levers, issuance cycles, index fee beta to market levels). The report presents minimal peer contrast and does not introduce monitoring signals or timelines. Decision relevance is modest: the fair value and EPS bridge are actionable but rely on generic inputs. With \u22653 insights restated/generic and no clear original thesis, originality is capped at Fair.",
