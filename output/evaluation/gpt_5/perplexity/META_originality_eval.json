    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains ample company detail but offers limited original interpretation. Most assertions restate publicly available facts (AI capex raise, Reality Labs losses, regulatory overhang, network effects) or generic sector takeaways. I found two modest syntheses: tying margin stabilization (38\u201340%) to post-build-out capex moderation and contained Reality Labs losses, and proposing a normalized capex/revenue ratio of 15% after the AI build. There is a weak original thesis that Threads could surpass X within a year, but it lacks mechanism, quantification, or financial linkage, reducing decision relevance. The valuation section is a standard DCF (growth, margins, WACC) without novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms (e.g., ad load/pricing uplift from AI, WhatsApp monetization path, Reels/Threads contribution bridge), triggering a cap at Fair. No clear catalysts or monitoring signals are articulated beyond management guidance and broad regulatory risks. Overall, the balance skews heavily toward restatements with minimal synthesis and limited company-distinct, actionable insights.",
