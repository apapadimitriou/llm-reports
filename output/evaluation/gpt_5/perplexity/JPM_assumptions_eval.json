{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report states several core assumptions near the valuation and forecast sections (explicitness), including revenue/loan growth ranges, efficiency ratio, credit provisions, and a valuation multiple. However, justification is weak: most inputs are asserted without supporting multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources beyond general statements (e.g., \u201cconsistent with peer group valuations\u201d), and there is no evidence-based tie to recent trends for NIM, credit costs, or margins. Specificity is partial: many items have magnitudes and ranges with annual horizons (e.g., 4\u20136% revenue growth; 51\u201353% efficiency), but NIM is left qualitative and key valuation levers like WACC/COE, terminal growth, tax rate, and share count are missing. Consistency shows at least one contradiction: \u201cRevenue growth of 4\u20136% annually\u201d conflicts with the table\u2019s FY2025E revenue decline versus FY2024A. Sensitivity is limited: there is a high-level fair value band ($280\u2013$360) but no quantified driver-level scenarios (e.g., NIM, credit losses, efficiency) with valuation impacts. Given the minimal sensitivity/scenario analysis and the noted inconsistency, the assumptions merit a Fair grade.",
