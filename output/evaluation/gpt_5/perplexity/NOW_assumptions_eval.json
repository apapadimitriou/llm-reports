    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation and forecast assumptions are generally explicit and placed close to the forecasts they inform (Fair Value and Profit Drivers; Appendix). Specificity is strong: ranges, units, and horizons are provided for revenue growth (20\u201322% for three years, moderating to 15\u201318%), gross margins (78\u201380%), FCF margin (35\u201338%), WACC (9.5%), terminal growth (4%), and peak operating margin (24%), with an EPS target for 2027. Internal consistency is largely clean, with assumptions reconciling to the Financials Snapshot (e.g., operating margin rising to 24% by 2029E; FCF margins trending toward 35\u201338%). Sensitivity/scenario analysis exists in the Appendix (base/bull/bear), quantified for several material drivers (revenue CAGR, WACC, terminal growth, peak margins) and shows fair value impacts. However, justification is partial: major parameters like WACC, terminal growth, gross margin stability, and FCF margin are asserted with limited evidence (no peer benchmarks, limited historical tie-outs). Material drivers such as tax rate, share count/dilution, and capex are missing/opaque. Given partial justification and limited sensitivity breadth beyond three scenarios, the assumptions quality merits a Fair grade.",
