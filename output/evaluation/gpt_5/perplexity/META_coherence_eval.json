    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear, well-structured narrative from the Analyst Note through Valuation, Risks, and Capital Allocation. Language is precise and transitions are mostly smooth; for example, the Analyst Note\u2019s emphasis on Q1 strength and elevated capex ties into the Valuation section\u2019s margin assumptions and the Financials Snapshot\u2019s lower 2025E FCF. Cross-references are explicit: Q1 EPS and guidance flow into the 2025E EPS in the table, and the capex guidance informs both risks and the modeled normalization in later years. The cover block\u2019s fair value matches the Valuation section\u2019s DCF output, reinforcing coherence.\n\nConsistency across sections is strong. The geographic revenue breakdown aligns with total revenue claims, and Reality Labs\u2019 loss figures are compatible across Analyst Note and Bears Say. Temporal references are appropriate (e.g., Q4 2024 RL losses; March 2025 policy changes) relative to the June 2025 report date. Terminology is used consistently (e.g., operating margin, capex, DAUs), and assumptions are carried through to sensitivities.\n\nMinor rough edges prevent an \u201cexcellent\u201d grade. The report uses bracketed citations extensively but provides no actual source list in the Sources section, weakening citation alignment. Also, while the Q1 operating margin of 41% versus 2025E 38.5% is plausible, the narrative could more explicitly reconcile the divergence. Two sections (Bulls/Bears, Appendix) are list-like, though expected in format. Overall, the report is cohesive and internally aligned.",
    "evidence": [
        "Valuation links operating assumptions to outcomes: \u201cRevenue bridge analysis shows Q1 2025 EPS of $6.43 growing to projected full-year 2025 EPS of $27.50,\u201d consistent with the Financials Snapshot (2025E EPS 27.50).",
        "Capex-risk coherently reflected: \u201c2025 capex guidance of $64-72 billion\u2026 ~40% of projected revenue\u201d and 2025E FCF declines to $48.2B in the Financials Snapshot.",
        "Citations mismatch: numerous bracketed references ([1], [5], [13]) but the Sources section lists no actual sources, undermining citation alignment."
