    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most headline sections with reasonable breadth: cover block and contents, an Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, and Appendix/Sources are present. Depth is mixed: narrative context on segments, pipeline mentions, and capital allocation are included, and the valuation section states explicit assumptions (growth, margin, discount rate, tax) and links them to drivers (new launches, geographic expansion, margin change). However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits multiple core sector KPIs (segment revenue breakdown, product-level sales, pipeline/trial phase metrics, MedTech volumes), triggering a comprehensiveness cap. Evidence integration is inconsistent: several material claims rely on outdated sources (2018\u20132020) or are not clearly supported by the cited references, weakening the report\u2019s evidentiary rigor. Peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis are absent, and key talking points (Stelara biosimilars) recur across sections with limited added depth. These gaps reduce proportionality and completeness despite the otherwise broad structure, resulting in a Fair grade under the decision rules.",
