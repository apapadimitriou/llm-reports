    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are partly explicit (WACC, terminal growth, revenue CAGR, normalized ROE, P/E multiple) and placed near the valuation/forecast sections, but justification is weak. Most parameters (WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 2.5%, 11.5x P/E) lack evidence-based support from history, peers, or cited sources. Specificity is mixed: some inputs have clear magnitudes and horizons (2025\u20132029 revenue CAGR 5%), while others are vague (EPS growth \u201cmid-to-high single-digit,\u201d \u201cmodest share count reduction\u201d with no numbers, no tax rate). Internal consistency has at least one numeric contradiction: $12 annual dividend vs a stated quarterly increase to $2.75, implying $11 annual. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for material levers (rates/market activity, margins/ROE, revenue growth, valuation parameters). Under the decision rules and hard caps, the absence of sensitivities combined with the contradiction drives a Poor grade, despite the presence of some explicit assumptions and a forecast table.",
