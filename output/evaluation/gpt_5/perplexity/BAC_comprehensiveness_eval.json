    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: cover block, contents, analyst note, business description, strategy, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, appendix, and sources. Depth is generally reasonable, with bank-relevant discussion of NII guidance, CET1, provisions, and net charge-offs. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic (revenue, operating margin, FCF, ROIC) and omits core bank KPIs (NIM, CET1, provisions, efficiency ratio, deposits), triggering a hard cap. Valuation references operating drivers (NII and fee growth) and provides key assumptions, but mixes DCF and P/E without a clear bridge or sensitivity analysis. Peer benchmarking is absent. Sourcing is inconsistent: several material claims rely on outdated sources (e.g., market cap and Q2 EPS) and ESG assertions lack in-text citations. Some repetition occurs (NII guidance reiterated across multiple sections) with limited incremental insight. Overall, while the structure is comprehensive, omissions in KPI tables, missing peer/scenario work, and citation issues reduce the report\u2019s comprehensiveness to Fair.",
