    "reasoning": "The report has a clear structure and a mostly coherent narrative arc: it opens with a performance-focused Analyst Note, details the business mix, and connects strategy (Fit for Growth) to valuation and margin assumptions. Transitions between sections are generally logical, and there are cross-references (e.g., MS decline and rare disease growth reappearing in Strategy, Bulls/Bears, and Valuation). However, internal consistency and source/date alignment issues materially weaken coherence. Key performance claims for Q2 2025 EPS and revenue are attributed to a 2021 source, undermining temporal accuracy and basic citation alignment. In Valuation, the WACC and fair value inputs rely on a 2022 \u201cintrinsic value\u201d source, creating an outdated underpinning for 2025 conclusions. There\u2019s also a tension between the stated EPS growth trajectory and the financial table: the narrative says EPS grows 4\u20136% annually through 2026, yet the table shows a decline in 2025 and a 7% increase in 2026, exceeding the range. While the Bulls/Bears are reasonably reconciled with the base-case (e.g., MS decline and Leqembi uncertainties reflected in assumptions), these temporal and numerical inconsistencies force a downgrade. Overall, the report is understandable with effort, but the reader must resolve time and citation mismatches, preventing a higher grade.",
