    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates some analytical depth with clear causal links and explicit, quantified assumptions, but lacks benchmarking and quantified sensitivity analysis. Strong causal explanations include \u201cdriven primarily by continued data center momentum\u201d and \u201cmargin pressure from regulatory headwinds and inventory adjustments,\u201d tying results to AI accelerator adoption and export-control impacts. The valuation section provides explicit inputs\u2014\u201cOperating margin expansion to the mid-20% range,\u201d \u201cWACC: 8.5%,\u201d and \u201cTerminal Growth Rate: 3.0%\u201d\u2014and the appendix summarizes key assumptions. Forecasts and financial snapshots are quantified across 2025\u20132029, and decision-relevant elements appear via a Fair-Value Estimate and Price/FVE comparison. However, inference quality is limited by the absence of benchmarking (e.g., no peer or historical checks for WACC, terminal growth, or margin trajectory) and the lack of quantified scenarios. The report acknowledges uncertainty\u2014\u201cSensitivity analysis indicates meaningful valuation dependence\u201d\u2014but provides no ranges or stress tests for AI revenue scaling, margins, or regulatory outcomes. Counterpoints are discussed qualitatively in Bulls/Bears and Risk sections, yet without numeric scenarios or sensitivities. Actionable implications exist (current price vs. FVE), but they are not conditionally tied to explicit scenario outcomes, constraining decision relevance.",
