    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear narrative arc from performance highlights (Analyst Note) through strategy, moat, valuation, risks, and capital allocation, with consistent terminology and cross-referencing. Transitions generally explain why each idea follows: Q1 2025 performance and AI revenue targets lead into competitive dynamics (Nvidia, white-box), which are then carried through to margin assumptions and conservative valuation in Fair Value and Profit Drivers. Assumptions align with the Financials Snapshot: 2025E revenue of 8.2B supports the cited ~17% growth, and operating margins trend to mid-40s as described. The Appendix\u2019s WACC (11.5%) matches the narrative\u2019s 10\u201312% range, and the fair value estimate ($82) ties back to Price/FVE in the cover. Bulls/Bears are largely reconciled with the base-case valuation: the conservative growth and margin pressures acknowledge bear concerns while the wide moat and hyperscaler ties support the bull case.\n\nMinor rough edges prevent an excellent grade. The cover\u2019s market cap and last price are not contextualized against share count, and the implied EV/S of ~12x at fair value is asserted without explicit linkage to the revenue table, which could use clearer connective math. Nonetheless, temporal references are precise (Q1 2025, June 2025 downgrades), and the report avoids internal contradictions and time-inaccurate \u201crecency\u201d claims, resulting in a coherent, well-structured analysis.",
    "evidence": [
        "Financials Snapshot shows 2024A revenue $7.0B and 2025E $8.2B, consistent with the narrative\u2019s ~17% growth guidance (Business Strategy & Outlook, Fair Value).",
        "Operating margin progression to mid-40% is described and reflected in the table (42.1% in 2024A to 43.5% in 2025E and 45.2% by 2029E) (Fair Value and Profit Drivers; Financials Snapshot).",
        "Fair value $82 and Price/FVE 1.16x in the cover are referenced and supported by conservative assumptions (Appendix; Fair Value and Profit Drivers)."
