    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely explicit and placed near forecasts (Fair Value section and a dedicated Appendix), covering core drivers such as organic revenue growth, margin trajectory, Ansys synergies, China impact, terminal growth, and discount rate. Specificity is decent: magnitudes, percentages, and horizons (e.g., \u201c8\u201310% organic growth,\u201d \u201c25% margin,\u201d \u201cYear 3 synergies,\u201d \u201cFY2027 penetration\u201d) are provided. However, justification is weak-to-partial; most inputs lack support from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources beyond a single synergy figure, and valuation choices (28x P/E, 10.5% discount, 3% terminal) are not anchored to evidence. Internal consistency is impaired by a numeric contradiction: the valuation applies 28x to \u201cfiscal 2026 EPS of $24.50,\u201d while the table shows 2026E EPS of $18.75 (24.50 is 2027E). Sensitivity analysis is effectively absent; the report offers a price range ($620\u2013$750) without quantifying driver-level scenarios (e.g., revenue/NIM bands, margin, WACC). Missing assumptions include tax rate, capex/working capital, and share count, limiting traceability of the model. Given the contradiction and lack of quantified sensitivities, the grade is capped at Fair.",
