    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear overall arc\u2014Discover-driven transformation, near-term integration drag, and medium-term synergy-led recovery\u2014and most sections use consistent terminology and logical transitions. Analyst Note, Strategy/Outlook, and Fair Value link the acquisition to expected synergies and capital flexibility, while Risks and Moat appropriately echo those themes. However, internal tensions reduce coherence. The claim that Q2 2025 revenue declined 81% year-over-year due to acquisition accounting is not reconciled with the Financials Snapshot projecting a sharp full-year revenue increase to $42.8B for FY 2025E, nor is the mechanism (one-time costs) typically tied to revenue rather than earnings; this creates an unexplained contradiction between narrative and table. Additionally, numerous bracketed citations ([1], [5], [16], etc.) appear throughout, but the Sources section provides no actual references, weakening narrative credibility and cross-section alignment. Some quantitative assertions (e.g., payment network revenues \u201c~$3B annually\u201d and NIM stabilizing at 7.0\u20137.3%) are not anchored to tables or assumptions, leaving gaps in the connective tissue between inputs and valuation outputs. Despite these issues, bulls/bears are reasonably reconciled with the base-case (synergy timeline, credit cost normalization), and temporal claims (SCB effective October 2025) are consistent. Overall, understandable with effort but internally noisy.",
