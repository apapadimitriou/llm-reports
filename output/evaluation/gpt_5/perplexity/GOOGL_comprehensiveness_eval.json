    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections: cover block and contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. Evidence citations are consistently used in-text with bracketed references, and the Valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (Search, YouTube, Cloud growth and margins) to DCF assumptions (WACC, terminal growth), with a brief sensitivity range. Proportionality is reasonable across segments, and capital allocation and regulatory risks receive adequate depth. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits core sector-specific KPIs for a digital advertising/cloud platform (e.g., Traffic Acquisition Costs, YouTube user/subscriber metrics or monetization KPIs, Cloud backlog/bookings), triggering the hard cap to Fair. Peer/industry context is present but lacks formal benchmarking or comparative metrics. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is limited to a short range within Valuation rather than a dedicated section. Redundancy is modest, with the $75B AI capex referenced across sections but generally in different contexts. Overall, the report is structurally complete but constrained by missing sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot and minimal peer benchmarking.",
