Specificity is solid\u2014assumptions are quantified and reconcile broadly with the forecast table (e.g., margins trending toward 25.8%). Justification is partial: narrative references to data center/AI momentum and historical margins provide context, but core parameters (WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 3%, tax rate 17%) lack evidence ties to market rates, peer benchmarks, or cited sources. Internal consistency has a notable issue: the text states \u201cmid-teens\u201d revenue CAGR while the Appendix specifies 12.8%, which is lower than mid-teens; this unresolved contradiction caps the grade at Fair. Stress-testing is absent\u2014no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis is provided for material levers (AI revenue scaling, margins, WACC/terminal growth)\u2014further capping the assessment. Several material assumptions (share count/dilution, capex intensity, working capital) are missing or opaque, limiting auditability. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified, with one contradiction and no quantified sensitivities.",
