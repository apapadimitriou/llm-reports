    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear, well-structured narrative with coherent sections (Analyst Note \u2192 Business Description \u2192 Strategy/Outlook \u2192 Moat \u2192 Valuation \u2192 Risks \u2192 Capital Allocation) and generally consistent terminology across most of the text. Transitions are smooth, and the valuation narrative references the appendix assumptions (e.g., WACC 8.5% and 5% revenue CAGR) while connecting profit drivers to segment dynamics. The financials table aligns with several cited figures (2024 revenue $53.5B; EPS ~$40.5). However, significant temporal and citation misalignments undermine coherence. The Analyst Note claims second quarter 2025 results on a report date of 2025-06-29 and cites a 2021 source for those figures, which is time-inaccurate and unsupported. The cover block\u2019s market cap references a 2018 source, and the dividend yield is tied to a 2022 source, both mismatched with 2025 context. There is also a minor metric inconsistency: the narrative highlights ROE (12.7% in 2024) while the table presents ROIC values, without reconciling the two. While Bulls/Bears are reasonably connected to the base-case valuation (compliance spend vs. margin leverage), the unresolved temporal and citation issues trigger an auto cap to fair. Overall, readable and connected, but internally noisy due to source/date mismatches.",
