    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and generally coherent narrative: Q1 2025 performance flows into backlog visibility, segment trends, and AI initiatives, which are later tied to margin expansion and valuation. Cross-references are reasonably explicit; for instance, the raised 2025 guidance (16.0\u201316.4) aligns with the Financials Snapshot (FY2025E revenue 16.2) and EPS guidance matches FY2025E EPS (11.90). Risks around leverage and macro headwinds appear consistently in Analyst Note, Risk & Uncertainty, and Capital Allocation, and are reflected in the valuation assumption of gradual deleveraging to 3.0x. Terminology is used consistently (e.g., constant currency growth, book-to-bill). However, there is a temporal inaccuracy: \u201cLast close: $179.98\u201d and market cap reference source [11] dated 2025-01-24, while the report date is 2025-05-07, implying the price is not truly the \u201clast close.\u201d Additionally, the fair value and WACC are attributed to source [9] from 2022, which weakens the coherence of claiming \u201cour discounted cash flow analysis\u201d in 2025 while citing an older external estimate. These issues do not undermine the overall argument but do constrain the grade under the guardrails. Apart from these, the flows are mostly smooth with minor reliance on dated sources in a few header items.",
