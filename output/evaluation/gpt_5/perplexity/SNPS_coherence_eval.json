    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear overall structure with a coherent narrative arc from results and strategic moves (Ansys acquisition, AI tools) through valuation, risks, and capital allocation. Language is generally clear, and most sections transition logically, with some cross-referencing (e.g., synergies and integration risks echoing valuation sensitivities). However, there are notable internal inconsistencies that undermine coherence. Most prominently, the Fair Value section cites a 2026 EPS of $24.50 for a forward multiple, while the Financials Snapshot table shows 2026E EPS at $18.75 and 2027E at $24.50. This mismatch directly conflicts with the valuation assumption. Additionally, Capital Allocation states a net cash position of $3.8 billion alongside a 101.4% debt-to-equity ratio, which is conceptually at odds and not reconciled. The China exposure discussion also contains an unresolved tension: the Analyst Note projects China revenue at $830 million for FY2025 (roughly 12% of total guidance), while Risks says China is approximately 15% of revenue, without explaining the difference. The valuation mixes DCF and a PE multiple without clarifying how they align, adding to analytical noise. While the Bulls/Bears are partially reconciled via sensitivity ranges, sections like Bulls/Bears and Risk & Uncertainty are list-like with limited connective tissue, contributing to choppiness. These issues warrant a fair grade under the guardrails.",
