    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is well-structured with clear section headers and a coherent narrative arc from performance and strategy to valuation, risk, and capital allocation. Language is generally clear, and key themes (oncology, women\u2019s health, autoimmune, neurology) are consistently referenced across Analyst Note, Strategy/Outlook, Moat, and Capital Allocation, which supports cross-section coherence. Terminology (EPS, FCF, ROIC, WACC) is used consistently, and the Financials Snapshot ties reasonably to the valuation discussion and capital allocation commentary. However, there are notable internal tensions and citation/date mismatches that undermine coherence. The most material contradiction is between the 2025 revenue growth guidance (6.7%\u20138.0%) and the table\u2019s 2024 to 2025 revenue increase (13.2B to 14.0B), which equates to roughly 6.1%, below the lower bound and not reconciled. Additionally, several key performance claims (e.g., Q2 2025 EPS/revenue and stock quote) are sourced to items dated 2021 or 2013, creating time-inaccurate support and reducing confidence in the connected argument. Bulls/Bears are reasonably articulated but not explicitly bridged to the base-case valuation beyond a general sensitivity range, leaving some risks (reimbursement, tech disruption) insufficiently integrated into the valuation drivers. These issues trigger the temporal hard cap and an auto-downgrade for unreconciled tensions.",
    "evidence": [
        "Financials Snapshot shows 2024 revenue $13.2B and 2025E $14.0B (~6.1% growth) while Analyst Note cites 2025 guidance of 6.7%\u20138.0%; this gap is not addressed.",
        "Analyst Note attributes Q2 2025 EPS/revenue to source [2] dated 2021-08-02, and stock quote to [6] dated 2021-08-28, indicating time-inaccurate citations for 2025 claims.",
        "Fair Value states ~15.5x forward P/E, but the report\u2019s own inputs (Last Close $258.50; 2025E EPS 16.05 in the table) imply a higher multiple, without reconciliation."
