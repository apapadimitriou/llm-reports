    "summary_reasoning": "The report offers a few company-specific syntheses but is mostly composed of restated public information and boilerplate framing. The clearest syntheses link the planned diabetes separation to margin mix improvement and a 50\u2013100 bps annual operating margin expansion, and connect tariff exposure ($200\u2013350m) to potential pricing/share consequences\u2014both decision-relevant but not deeply quantified. Another synthesis argues Medtronic\u2019s AI/robotics ecosystem could drive recurring software revenue, yet lacks numbers, benchmarks, or clear catalysts. The valuation section relies on standard DCF scaffolding (mid-single-digit growth, WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 2.5%) with limited novel mechanisms beyond stating the diabetes revenue removal; it does not quantify separation\u2019s impact on margins in the valuation bridge. Multiple generic elements (aging demographics, minimally invasive trends, competitive pressure, regulatory timing) reduce originality. While the report references peers (Intuitive Surgical, Boston Scientific, Abbott), peer contrasts are not leveraged into unique angles. With \u22653 insights classified as generic/restated and only modest synthesis, actionability is limited, capping the grade at Fair.",
