    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are generally explicit and proximate to the forecasts: revenue growth, margin trajectory, WACC, terminal growth, FCF conversion, and a Venmo revenue contribution are all stated in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section and Appendix. Specificity is solid: magnitudes and time horizons are provided (e.g., 4\u20136% revenue growth through 2029, WACC 9.2%, terminal growth 3%, target operating margin 23%, FCF conversion 85\u201390%). However, justification is weak: most inputs lack evidence ties to multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources; WACC, terminal growth, transaction margin (46%), and Venmo\u2019s $1.5B uplift are asserted without support. Internal consistency has a numeric issue: the table shows 2025E revenue growth of ~3.8% vs the stated 4\u20136% \u201cthrough 2029,\u201d with no reconciliation. Sensitivity analysis is essentially absent; a fair value \u201crange of $75\u201395\u201d is cited without driver-level sensitivities or quantified scenarios, triggering the hard cap at Fair. Several material drivers are missing or opaque, including tax rate, share count effects from large buybacks, capex/working capital, and credit losses related to BNPL/credit products. Overall, while the assumptions are fairly explicit and specific, they lack robust evidence and scenario analysis, and include a minor table-text mismatch.",
