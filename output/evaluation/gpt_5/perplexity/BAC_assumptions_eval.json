    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are mostly explicit and proximate to the forecasts (NII growth, fee growth, expense growth, ROE, WACC/COE, terminal growth, valuation multiple). Specificity is decent: magnitudes, units, and timeframes are given (e.g., \u201c$15.5\u2013$15.7 billion by Q4 2025,\u201d \u201c6\u20137% full-year growth,\u201d \u201c6% annual fee income growth,\u201d \u201c2\u20133% expense growth,\u201d \u201cCOE/WACC 9.2%,\u201d \u201cterminal 2%,\u201d \u201c11.5x P/E\u201d). However, justification is weak-to-partial: several core inputs (fee growth, ROE normalization, WACC/COE, terminal growth, P/E multiple) lack evidence tied to multi-year history, peers, or cited sources; only NII guidance is linked to management outlook. Internal consistency has minor issues: the report references a DCF-WACC approach while also relying on a P/E multiple, and labels 9.2% as WACC in one section and COE in another without reconciling methodology. Critically, no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis is provided on material drivers (rates/NII, credit costs, margins, valuation), which triggers the hard cap at Fair. Important drivers are missing or opaque (tax rate, share count trajectory, credit loss assumptions), weakening auditability and completeness of the model inputs.",
