    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is well-structured with clear section headers and a coherent arc from Q2 FY25 results to strategy, valuation, risks, and capital allocation. Language is generally clear, and many sections reference each other effectively (e.g., raised FY25 guidance appears in Analyst Note and aligns with FY25E revenue in the Financials Snapshot; competitive and AI themes recur in Strategy, Bulls/Bears, and Risks). However, there is a notable internal inconsistency around operating margins: Fair Value and Profit Drivers states non-GAAP operating margins are at \u201capproximately 45%\u201d and can expand to 47\u201348%, while the Financials Snapshot narrative says margins will expand \u201cfrom current levels near 36%\u201d to 47\u201348%\u2014without clarifying whether these refer to GAAP vs non-GAAP or differing time frames. This contradiction among narrative and assumptions triggers a hard cap to fair. Additionally, the report cites numerous sources with bracketed references ([1], [2], etc.) and lists \u201cSources\u201d in the Contents but does not provide an actual Sources section, which undermines citation coherence. Despite these issues, most figures and claims (segment mix, ARR, FY25 guidance, EPS trajectory) are internally consistent, and Bulls/Bears are reasonably reconciled via valuation sensitivities. Overall, understandable with effort but internally noisy due to the margin inconsistency and missing sources.",
