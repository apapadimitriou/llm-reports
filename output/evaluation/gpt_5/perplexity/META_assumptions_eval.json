    "summary_reasoning": "The report states the principal valuation drivers explicitly and near the forecasts they inform: multi\u2011year revenue growth bands, operating margin targets, normalized capex intensity, WACC, terminal growth, and FCF margin. Specificity is generally solid with numeric magnitudes and time horizons (e.g., 12\u201315% growth through 2027; WACC 9.2%; terminal growth 3.0%). Internal consistency between narrative, appendix, and the \u201cFinancials Snapshot\u201d table is clean; margin targets and EPS/FCF align with the tabulated projections. However, justification is weak: the DCF inputs (WACC, terminal growth, 14% ad revenue CAGR, 15% capex/revenue) lack supporting evidence from history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources. Several important drivers are missing or opaque, including tax rate, share count/dilution, and explicit treatment of working capital and segment mix, limiting auditability. Sensitivity analysis is only qualitative; there are no quantified ranges or scenario impacts on valuation for key levers (ad growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth, Reality Labs losses). Given the absence of quantified stress tests, the analysis is capped at Fair despite otherwise clear and mostly specific assumptions.",
