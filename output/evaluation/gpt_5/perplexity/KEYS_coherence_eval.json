    "reasoning": "The report is well structured with clear sectioning and generally smooth transitions; themes like software mix shift, tariff headwinds, and the pending Spirent deal recur across Analyst Note, Strategy/Outlook, Valuation, Risks, and Capital Allocation, supporting a coherent arc. However, multiple internal inconsistencies cap coherence. Most notably, the Economic Moat section claims $230 million in R&D is 18% of revenue \u201cannually,\u201d which contradicts the scale implied by the Financials Snapshot (annual revenue ~$5.1\u20135.4 billion). The Bulls/Bears section asserts \u201cconsistent margin expansion,\u201d while the Financials Snapshot shows operating margin declining from 22.1% (2022A) to 21.2% (2024A) before rising in the out-years, an unaddressed tension. In Valuation, Spirent is expected to add $400\u2013$450 million of annual revenue, yet the 2026E revenue only rises by ~$320 million over 2025E, implying the acquisition\u2019s contribution is not reflected in the model or is not explained. There is also a soft inconsistency in calling the balance sheet \u201cminimal debt\u201d alongside a stated 46% debt-to-equity ratio. While most temporal references are plausible and sections cross-reference reasonably, these contradictions among assumptions, narrative, and the table require the reader to reconcile important details themselves, limiting overall coherence to fair under the rubric\u2019s hard-cap guardrail.",
