    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with reasonable depth: a clear cover block and contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, and Appendix/Sources. Evidence is generally integrated via in-text citations, and the valuation section articulates drivers (growth, margins, WACC) linked to a DCF-derived fair value. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic, lacking multiple sector-specific KPIs for networking/software (e.g., ARR/NRR, AI revenue breakdown, backlog/book-to-bill, port shipments, segment mix), triggering the KPI hard cap. Peer context is discussed (Nvidia, white-box vendors) but there is no formal peer benchmarking or sensitivity/scenario analysis. Some repetition exists (competition/tariffs across Analyst Note, Bears, Risks), though it adds limited new depth. Additionally, several cover block items (price, market cap, ratings) are presented without explicit citations. Overall, headline coverage is present, but the absence of core KPIs and analytical scenarios keeps the grade at Fair.",
