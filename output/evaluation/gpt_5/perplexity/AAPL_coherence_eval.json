    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and a largely cohesive narrative: segment mix (iPhone 56%, Services 21%) is introduced in the Analyst Note and used consistently in Business Description, Bulls/Bears, and valuation assumptions. Key drivers (services growth, hardware moderation, AI timing) flow into the Fair Value section, which references operating margin and WACC and connects to Risks (tariffs potentially compressing margins). The Financials Snapshot aligns with the stated assumptions (mid-single-digit revenue CAGR, ~31% operating margin, EPS driven by buybacks) and the base case reconciles the Bulls/Bears by assuming modest iPhone declines offset by services growth.\n\nHowever, source/date alignment issues introduce internal noise and trigger a hard cap: several current claims are supported by older or generic citations (e.g., market cap and operating margin figures citing sources from 2018 and 2017). This undermines temporal coherence, particularly where specific 2025 performance metrics are presented. While transitions are generally smooth and sections reference each other, the reliance on mismatched citations leaves some assertions insufficiently supported within the report\u2019s own sourcing framework. There are no clear contradictions between tables and narrative, and terminology is used consistently. Overall, it\u2019s understandable and reasonably connected, but the time-inaccurate sourcing and a few thinly supported claims prevent a \u201cgood\u201d grade.",
    "evidence": [
        "Operating margin: \u201cQ2 2025 performance of 31.03%\u201d is tied to Source 12 (GuruFocus, 2017), indicating temporal misalignment (Fair Value and Profit Drivers).",
        "Market cap ($3.404T) and price references are paired with a MacroTrends 2018 citation, weakening current-date support (Cover Block / Sources 4).",
        "Tariff impact (up to 83% rates; $900M quarterly costs) is repeatedly cited to a single article (Source 19), but the narrative does link this risk to potential 200\u2013300 bps margin pressure (Risks \u2194 Fair Value)."
