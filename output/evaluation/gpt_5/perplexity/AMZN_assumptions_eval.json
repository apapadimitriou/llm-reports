    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are stated explicitly and proximate to the forecasts, particularly in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section and the Appendix. Specificity is solid: most assumptions include numeric ranges, units, and clear time horizons (e.g., AWS CAGR 15\u201317% through 2029, NA margins 6.3% \u2192 8\u20139%, WACC 9.5%, terminal growth 3.0%). However, justification is partial: while the narrative cites segment trends and management commentary, the model inputs lack rigorous evidence linkage (multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or sourced parameter derivations) for key items like WACC, terminal growth, and margin trajectories. Internal consistency appears mostly clean; projected margin expansion aligns with the Financials Snapshot, and growth rates are coherent across sections. Importantly, the report provides no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis on material drivers (e.g., rates/WACC, margins, AWS growth), which triggers a hard cap at Fair per decision rules. Several material assumptions are missing or opaque (tax rate, share count trajectory, capex path in the valuation), and some parameters are used without clear sourcing. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific but short on evidence and stress-testing.",
