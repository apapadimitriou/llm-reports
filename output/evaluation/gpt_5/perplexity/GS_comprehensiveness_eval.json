    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most headline sections (cover block, contents, analyst note, business description, strategy, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, financials, ESG, appendix, sources). Scope is broad and proportionally balanced across GS\u2019s two segments, with some sector context (M&A leadership, AUS, IB fees). However, comprehensiveness is impaired by the Financials Snapshot\u2019s generic KPI set; it omits core bank/investment banking metrics such as NIM, CET1, provisions, efficiency ratio, and segment revenue breakdown. Valuation includes assumptions (revenue CAGR, ROE, WACC, terminal growth) and articulates drivers (IB fees, trading, AWM fees), but lacks a quantitative bridge and sensitivities. Evidence integration is inconsistent: several material claims use outdated sources or lack citations (e.g., market cap, dividend/last close, share repurchase size, CET1 buffer, Marcus deposits). Peer benchmarking is absent beyond leadership mentions; no comparative metrics vs key rivals. Redundancy appears where M&A leadership and regulatory scrutiny recur across multiple sections without deeper analysis. Per decision rules, missing sector KPIs and inconsistent sourcing cap the grade at Fair.",
