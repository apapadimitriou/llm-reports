It explains mechanisms such as fulfillment redesign lowering costs and capex impacting free cash flow, e.g., \u201creducing per-unit fulfillment costs\u201d and \u201cprimarily focused on AI and AWS capacity expansion.\u201d Forecasts are granular by segment with ranges for growth and margins, e.g., \u201cAWS margins are projected to stabilize around 35-40%,\u201d \u201cOperating margin expansion to 12.3% by 2029,\u201d and a cost of capital/terminal profile (\u201cWACC: 9.5%,\u201d \u201cTerminal growth rate: 3.0%\u201d). Inference quality is strengthened by linking retail growth to specific levers (\u201cdriven by market share expansion and Prime membership penetration\u201d) and by referencing cloud adoption tailwinds. Data use is extensive, with multi-year revenue, margin, EPS, and FCF projections, plus SOTP-style valuation anchors and a note that the blended multiple is at a discount to historical ranges. However, the analysis lacks quantified sensitivity or scenario work (no FTC or capex/FCF downside cases, no AI chip supply sensitivity), and several assumptions are not benchmarked to peers or historical ranges beyond limited references. Actionable implications are present (risk-reward framed amid capex and regulatory risks), but the absence of scenario analysis limits decision relevance under uncertainty.",
