    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: cover block and contents, analyst note, business description, strategy and outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation and profit drivers, risks, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, appendix, and sources. The proportional depth is generally solid, with a clear valuation framework (growth by segment, margin expansion, WACC, terminal growth) that links operating drivers to the fair value. Evidence is integrated via in-text citations throughout, and peers and regulatory context are mentioned, though without formal benchmarking. However, the Financials Snapshot is largely generic, omitting multiple medtech-specific KPIs (e.g., gross margin, organic growth by segment, R&D as % of sales, segment/geographic mix), triggering the KPI hard cap. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is also absent. Sourcing is inconsistent in places, with at least two material data points uncited or tied to outdated sources (e.g., market cap reference). Redundancy is limited; recurring themes (diabetes separation, robotics/AI pipeline) appear across sections but are generally extended with new context. Overall, breadth is good, but missing sector KPIs in the snapshot and citation issues constrain comprehensiveness to Fair.",
