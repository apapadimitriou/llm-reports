    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The report is well-structured with a clear narrative arc: it opens with an Analyst Note summarizing Q1 2025 performance and valuation context, proceeds through Business Description and Strategy/Outlook, and culminates in a detailed Valuation section supported by a Financials Snapshot and risk considerations. Terminology is used consistently (e.g., adjusted operating margin, recurring revenue, WACC), and transitions generally explain why the next idea follows. For example, the Strategy/Outlook on biopharma exposure and R&D investment connects cleanly to the Moat and Valuation sections, which rely on switching costs, scale, and margin expansion to justify the fair value. Cross-references are present: tariff headwinds and mitigation appear in Analyst Note, Bears Say, and Risk & Uncertainty, reinforcing the same point rather than duplicating it. Assumptions in the Financials Snapshot (revenue and margin trajectories) align with the Valuation narrative and Appendix assumptions. Minor rough edges persist: the Valuation states that applying a 19\u201320x multiple to 2027 EPS yields $525\u2013$555 but says this \u201csupports\u201d a $485 base case without explicitly reconciling the gap (discounting or chosen multiple), and Bulls/Bears are presented as lists with limited integration. However, there are no material contradictions among tables, assumptions, and narrative, and temporal claims are appropriate. Overall coherence is strong with only modest areas needing clearer linkage.",
    "evidence": [
        "Valuation ties revenue growth (to ~$49.6B by 2027) and margin expansion (from 22.6% toward mid-20%) to EPS growth (~$27.68 by 2027), matching the Financials Snapshot.",
        "Tariff headwinds are consistently addressed across sections: Analyst Note (China tariff pressures), Bears Say ($400M revenue, $375M OI), and Risk & Uncertainty (12\u201318 months mitigation).",
        "Minor tension: Valuation says 19\u201320x on 2027 EPS implies $525\u2013$555 yet describes $485 base case as \u2018supported\u2019 without specifying the base-case multiple or discounting."
