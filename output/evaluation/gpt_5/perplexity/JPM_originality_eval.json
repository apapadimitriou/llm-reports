    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report largely restates public information and uses boilerplate framing without delivering unique, decision-relevant insights. Earnings beats, CET1 strength, and \u201cfortress balance sheet\u201d/scale narratives are repeated without novel mechanisms or peer-specific contrasts. The valuation section applies standard assumptions (loan growth, NIM stabilization, fee growth, efficiency ratio) to a conventional P/E-based fair value; it lacks any distinctive driver (e.g., deposit beta dynamics, duration positioning, or regulatory capital ripple effects on ROE trajectory) and provides no catalysts or monitoring signals. Risk discussion (credit normalization, CRE, rate sensitivity, regulatory pressure) is generic to the sector. While some company details (AWM margins/ROE, dividend/buybacks) are included, they are presented as restatements rather than synthesized into new conclusions. No original theses are proposed, and there are no explicit causal links quantified with numbers and timelines. Given zero clear syntheses/original theses and multiple generic restatements, the originality of insights is poor and decision relevance is limited.",
