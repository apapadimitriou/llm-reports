    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly restated company guidance and widely reported facts (Humira decline, Skyrizi/Rinvoq growth, recent acquisitions). I identified one modest synthesis: linking Q1\u201925 immunology momentum to a claim that AbbVie can exceed prior revenue peaks by 2025. However, the remaining insights largely echo management projections (e.g., >$31B Skyrizi/Rinvoq by 2027), generic risk framing (net debt ~2.5x, higher rates), boilerplate moat language (IP/biologics complexity), and a standard DCF with conventional assumptions (7\u20138% CAGR, 45\u201347% margins, 7.5% WACC, 3% terminal growth) without a novel driver or mechanism. There are no unique, company-specific theses with quantified causal links, peer contrasts, or concrete catalysts beyond timelines already provided by management. Decision relevance is present in valuation and risk points, but originality is limited. Hard caps apply: 3+ generic/restated insights and a valuation section without novel drivers cap the grade at Fair.",
