    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains extensive company detail but offers minimal original insight. Most analysis reiterates public data: EPS, CET1, dividend increase, digital metrics, and management\u2019s NII guidance. One weak synthesis links BAC\u2019s asset-sensitive balance sheet to management\u2019s NII outlook, but it largely mirrors guidance without new causal mechanisms (e.g., deposit betas, duration, mix shifts). The valuation section uses generic assumptions (normalized ROTCE, WACC, P/E) and lacks novel drivers, breaching the hard cap for originality. Risk discussion (credit normalization, rate sensitivity, fintech competition) is boilerplate and not company-distinct. No original, testable thesis with catalysts or quantified pathways appears, and there is no peer-relative angle. Decision relevance is low: the few actionable statements (valuation vs fair value, dividend yield) are standard and unspecific. Overall, the report is a well-structured restatement with limited synthesis and no unique thesis, warranting a Fair grade under the decision rules.",
