    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report states many key inputs explicitly and with clear units, horizons, and locations (e.g., revenue to $110B by FY2027, operating margin to 65% by FY2027, WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 3%, terminal P/E 33x), meeting the explicitness and specificity pillars. However, justification is weak: most drivers (WACC, terminal growth, terminal multiple, AI revenue CAGR) are asserted without support from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited source excerpts. Internal consistency is compromised by at least two numeric contradictions: FY2024 revenue is cited as approximately $57B in the narrative and used as the baseline in valuation discussion, while the financial table shows FY2024A revenue of $51.6B; and R&D is described as ~25% of FY2022 revenue yet also as $4.9B, which does not reconcile with the report\u2019s own FY2022 revenue figure. Stress-testing is absent: there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios on material levers (AI revenue, total revenue CAGR, margins, WACC, terminal assumptions), which triggers the hard cap. Given multiple contradictions and the lack of quantified sensitivity analysis, the overall quality of assumptions is poor despite their explicitness and specificity.",
