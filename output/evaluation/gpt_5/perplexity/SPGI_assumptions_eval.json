{
    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key modeling assumptions are mostly explicit and located near the valuation discussion, with clear magnitudes and time horizons for revenue CAGR, margin expansion, EPS trajectory, WACC, terminal growth, and the valuation multiple. Specificity is decent (quantified ranges for growth and margins; explicit WACC and terminal growth; a multi\u2011year forecast table), but share count is referenced only qualitatively without magnitude or timing. Justification is weak: assumptions are not tied to multi\u2011year company history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources; WACC lacks component build-up; terminal growth and target multiple lack empirical support. Internal consistency is broadly acceptable, though there is a minor tension between the statement that margins \u201cshould gradually expand\u201d and the forecast table showing a dip from 2024A to 2025E before rising; the total expansion from 2024A to 2029E does fall within the stated 100\u2013200 bps range. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis linking variations in key drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth) to valuation or EPS outcomes. Under the stated hard caps, the absence of sensitivity analysis constrains the grade to Fair despite otherwise clear, proximate assumptions.",
