    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is largely a compilation of publicly available data (guidance, segment growth, acquisitions, FARAPULSE adoption) with minimal interpretive value-add. Of the 6 candidate insights identified, 5 are restatements of company press releases or common sector narratives, and only 1 constitutes a weak synthesis (tying acquisitions and tariff headwinds to continued double-digit growth). There are no original theses with quantified mechanisms, peer benchmarks, or explicit timelines; catalysts like the Agent DCB FDA approval are mentioned without numbers or timing. The valuation section is boilerplate DCF with standard assumptions (WACC, terminal growth, multiples) and lacks novel drivers or a company-specific mechanism, which triggers the Fair cap. Decision relevance is limited: only two insights hint at actionability (tariff resilience via M&A; potential upside from Agent DCB), but both are vague and unquantified. No peer-specific comparisons, deposit-beta-like drivers, or explicit monitoring signals are provided. Overall, originality is low, with the content skewed toward restating guidance and product momentum rather than generating unique, decision-relevant conclusions.",
