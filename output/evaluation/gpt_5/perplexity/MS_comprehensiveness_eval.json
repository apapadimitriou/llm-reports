    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections with a clear structure: Cover/Contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. The Analyst Note and Strategy sections provide reasonable depth, and the Valuation section explicitly links segment growth, margin assumptions, and WACC to the fair value, which is a strength. Evidence is generally cited consistently with bracketed references and a sources list. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic (revenue, EPS, FCF, ROIC) and omits core sector KPIs for an investment bank/wealth manager, such as NII/NIM, ROTCE, efficiency ratio, CET1 (in the table), and Wealth Management net new assets/client assets, triggering the hard cap to Fair. There is no peer benchmarking or scenario/sensitivity analysis, limiting industry context and robustness of conclusions. While some themes (integrated model) recur across sections, repetition is not excessive and usually adds context. Overall, solid breadth and reasonable linkage from drivers to valuation, but the lack of sector KPIs in the snapshot and absent peer/scenario analysis meaningfully reduce comprehensiveness.",
