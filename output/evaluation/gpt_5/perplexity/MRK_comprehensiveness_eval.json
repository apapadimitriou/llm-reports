    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections, including cover block, contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. Valuation assumptions are explicit and link operating drivers (Keytruda erosion, Winrevair ramp, Verona/Ohtuvayre contribution, WACC, margins) to a fair value outcome. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks biopharma-specific KPIs (product-level sales segmentation, R&D intensity, pipeline milestones, LOE timeline), triggering a KPI-based cap. Evidence integration is uneven: several material claims rely on outdated/mismatched sources (e.g., 2025 EPS and market cap citing 2021/2017 sources), capping the grade. Peer benchmarking is absent, and there is no scenario/sensitivity analysis. There is mild repetition of the Keytruda patent-cliff talking point across sections with limited incremental detail. Overall, breadth is good, but missing sector KPIs and inconsistent sourcing reduce comprehensiveness to Fair.",
