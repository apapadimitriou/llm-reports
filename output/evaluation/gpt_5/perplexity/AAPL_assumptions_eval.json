    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely explicit and proximal to the valuation, especially in the Appendix and Fair Value & Profit Drivers sections. Specificity is solid: the report states magnitudes, units, and horizons (e.g., revenue CAGR 2025\u201329 of 4.5%, operating margin range of 30.8%\u201332.0%, WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 2.5%, share count reduction 3.5% annually). Consistency appears clean: these inputs reconcile with the financial snapshot (revenue/EPS trajectories and margin path). However, justification is partial: some drivers are connected to recent performance (e.g., ~31% operating margin tied to Q2 2025) and services growth trends, but key valuation parameters (WACC, terminal growth, services margin expansion to 74%) lack rigorous evidence, peer benchmarking, or source citations. Stress-testing is limited: while a few ranges are mentioned (e.g., services growth 12\u201315%, potential 200\u2013300 bps tariff-related margin pressure), there is no structured sensitivity/scenario analysis quantifying valuation impact across material levers (revenue, margins, WACC, terminal growth). The absence of tax-rate and capex assumptions further weakens completeness. Overall, the inputs are clear and internally coherent, but the lack of robust sensitivity work and modest justification caps the assessment at Fair.",
