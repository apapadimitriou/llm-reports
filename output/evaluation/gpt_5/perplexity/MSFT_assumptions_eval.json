    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is reasonably strong: the report states core drivers near the valuation (revenue CAGR 13\u201315% to FY27, Azure 28\u201330%, operating margin path to 48\u201350%, WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 3%). Specificity is solid with magnitudes, units, and time horizons. However, justification is only partial: several pivotal inputs (WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 3%, $50B AI revenue by FY27, margin expansion) lack rigorous support from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited source triangulation; references are present but do not substantively underwrite the magnitudes. Internal consistency is mostly clean, though there are minor issues (e.g., \u201c45.6% currently\u201d vs the table\u2019s 2024 actual 43.4% and a stated FCF margin 33.4% that differs slightly from table-implied levels). Sensitivity analysis is weak: while some inputs are given as ranges (e.g., Azure 28\u201330%, revenue 13\u201315%, margin +200\u2013300 bp), there is no quantified scenario or sensitivity linking these ranges to valuation or target price impacts. Several material levers are missing or opaque (tax rate, share count/buybacks, capex/NWC dynamics), which limits auditability of the DCF and EPS bridge. Given partial justification and limited quantitative stress-testing, the overall quality of assumptions merits a Fair grade.",
