    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains a mix of restated company updates and some company-specific synthesis. Three insights are largely restatements of public information (AI/data center tailwinds, tariff mitigation, FCF surge), while two are syntheses (linking software/services mix to margin improvement and tying raised guidance plus ARR to visibility/margins). One original thesis appears in the valuation section, projecting Spirent\u2019s annual revenue contribution ($400\u2013450M) and explicitly connecting mix shift to a 200\u2013300 bps gross margin uplift, with a timeline. These are decision-relevant and quantified, but the report still leans heavily on management headline recaps and boilerplate moat language. Because there are \u22653 restated/generic insights, the hard cap limits the grade to Fair even though a novel driver is present in valuation. Actionability exists in the Spirent contribution and mix-shift mechanism, but the overall originality is diluted by generic sector framing and reliance on guidance rather than deeper peer contrasts or unique datasets.",
