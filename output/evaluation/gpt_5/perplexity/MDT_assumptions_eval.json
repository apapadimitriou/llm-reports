    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Several core inputs are explicitly stated (segment growth bands, WACC, terminal growth, FCF conversion, margin trajectory), but justification is limited: figures are asserted without multi-year historical reconciliation, peer benchmarks, or cited sources. Specificity is mixed\u2014some assumptions have clear magnitudes and horizons (e.g., \u201cWACC: 8.5%\u201d, \u201cTerminal growth rate: 2.5%\u201d), while others are vague (e.g., \u201cmodest share count reduction\u201d) and omit tax rate and capex. Internal consistency is impaired by unresolved contradictions: FY25 EPS in the narrative (adjusted $5.49) conflicts with the FY25E EPS (3.61) in the table; margin expansion is stated as \u201c50\u2013100 bps annually\u201d in one section versus \u201c100\u2013150 bps over 5 years\u201d in the appendix. Sensitivity analysis is absent\u2014no quantified ranges/scenarios tie key levers (growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth) to valuation. Under the decision rules and hard caps, the combination of at least one contradiction and no sensitivities warrants a Poor grade. While assumptions are partially explicit and specific, lack of evidence, contradictions, and no stress-testing materially undermine reliability.",
