    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are largely explicit and proximal to the forecasts: revenue CAGR (2025\u20132029), WACC, terminal growth, target operating margin, software mix trajectory, capex intensity, and the Spirent contribution are all clearly stated with magnitudes and time horizons. Specificity is solid, with numeric ranges (e.g., 3\u20134% capex, 200\u2013300 bps margin lift) and defined periods (\u201cnext three years\u201d). However, justification is partial at best: several inputs (WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 3%, capex %, Spirent $400\u2013450M, software mix to 45%) lack cited sources, peer/industry benchmarks, or reconciliation to company history. Internal consistency has at least one contradiction (R&D $230M asserted as 18% of revenue vs the report\u2019s >$5B revenue base). Sensitivity analysis is absent; material levers are acknowledged qualitatively but not quantified with ranges or valuation impacts, triggering a hard cap at Fair. Overall, while the assumptions are explicit and specific, they are weakly justified and not stress-tested, with a notable numeric inconsistency.",
