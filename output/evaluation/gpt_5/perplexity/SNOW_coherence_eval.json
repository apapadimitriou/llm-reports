    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure with logical sectioning and generally smooth transitions from strategy to moat, valuation, and risks. Terminology is used consistently (e.g., net revenue retention, RPO, multi-cloud), and the base-case valuation acknowledges execution risk while offering a sensitivity range, which helps connect Bulls/Bears to the fair value view. However, internal inconsistencies and temporal issues undermine coherence. Growth rates for recent quarters are not consistent: Q4 FY2025 product revenue growth is cited as 28% in the Analyst Note but 27% in Bears, and Q2 is described as 30% in the narrative while other parts imply 29%. More materially, the Financials Snapshot labels FY2025 as an estimate (FY 2025E) even though Q4 FY2025 results and full-year figures are discussed as reported, creating a narrative\u2013table mismatch. Temporal alignment of cited data is also shaky: the cover\u2019s market cap source is dated well before the report date, and a 2021 source is invoked for 2025 earnings framing, raising recency concerns. Despite otherwise solid flow and cross-referencing (RPO, NRR, partnerships reappearing across sections), these contradictions and time mismatches require an attentive reader to reconcile details, capping the grade at fair under the stated guardrails.",

        "Inconsistent growth rates: Q4 FY2025 growth stated as 28% (Analyst Note) vs 27% (Bears Say); Q2 characterized as 30% elsewhere.",
        "Financials Snapshot uses FY 2025E while the narrative reports FY2025 actuals (Q4 and full year), creating a narrative\u2013table mismatch.",
        "Cover uses market cap from a July 2024 source for a February 2025 report date; a 2021 source is cited regarding 2025 earnings context."
