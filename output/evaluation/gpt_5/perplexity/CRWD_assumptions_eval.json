    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are mostly explicit and co-located with the valuation discussion and forecast table. Key drivers are stated with magnitudes and horizons (e.g., revenue CAGR, operating margin trajectory, WACC), and a simple base/bull/bear table provides quantified scenario ranges for 2\u20133 core inputs with fair value per share outcomes. Internal consistency between narrative and the financial snapshot (e.g., EPS ~$4.50 in FY2029, operating margin ~25.5% by FY2029, revenue path implying ~16% CAGR) is clean. However, justification is weak: the report does not benchmark the 25\u201330% operating margin target, 15\u201318% revenue CAGR, or 9% WACC to history, peers, or sourced market data; the valuation multiples (35\u201340x EPS; 12\u201315x revenue) are asserted without evidence. Several material assumptions are missing or opaque, including tax rate, dilution/share count, SBC effects, working capital/FCF drivers, and terminal growth assumptions (only terminal operating margin is provided). Sensitivities are present but limited to a few inputs and not tied to operational levers (e.g., churn/NRR, pricing, module attach, SBC dilution). Given the weak justification and limited scope of sensitivity analysis despite good explicitness and internal coherence, the overall quality of assumptions merits a Fair grade.",
