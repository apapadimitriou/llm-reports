    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic restatements with a few weak syntheses. It links decelerating growth (34% \u2192 27%) to a maturity risk and ties RPO/NRR/customer metrics to future expansion, which are modest syntheses but not deeply novel. The valuation section employs standard assumptions (CAGR, margin progression, WACC) and a sum-of-the-parts framing without introducing unique drivers or mechanisms; forward P/S context is helpful but generic. The AI \u2018picks and shovels\u2019 positioning, multi-cloud differentiation, and hyperscaler competition are boilerplate sector narratives. Decision relevance is limited: while the $205 fair value and customer growth forecast are specific, there are few concrete catalysts/timelines or peer-specific contrasts. With \u22653 insights categorized as restated/generic and no strong original thesis, and a valuation section lacking novel drivers, the hard caps constrain the grade to Fair.",
