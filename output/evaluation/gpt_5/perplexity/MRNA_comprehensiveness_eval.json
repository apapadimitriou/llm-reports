    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections, including a clear cover block, contents, executive summary, business description and strategy, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, ESG, appendix, and sources. Depth is reasonable in narrative areas (pipeline context, cost reductions, respiratory franchise) and the valuation section links revenue/margin drivers to the fair value with assumptions (WACC, product-level revenue, cost cuts). However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits core biopharma KPIs (e.g., R&D expense trajectory, cash/runway, product-level sales, gross margin, pipeline milestones), triggering the hard cap to Fair. Evidence integration is uneven: while many claims are bracketed, some key items are uncited or rely on outdated/non-authoritative sources (e.g., Q2 2025 figures tied to a 2021 MarketBeat page; gross margin target without a clear source; R&D spend from a blog). Peer context appears qualitatively, but there is no formal peer benchmarking table, and there is no scenario/sensitivity analysis. Some redundancy exists around competitive pressures and cost-reduction themes across sections. Overall, it is a broadly structured report with several gaps in KPI coverage and citation rigor that limit comprehensiveness.",
