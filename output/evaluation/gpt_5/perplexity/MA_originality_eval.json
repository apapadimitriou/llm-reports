    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains two syntheses linking drivers to outcomes (e.g., GDV/cross-border/value\u2011added services growth plus buybacks \u2192 15\u201318% EPS CAGR; mix shift to value\u2011added services \u2192 margin expansion), but these mechanisms are standard for card networks and not deeply differentiated or tied to specific catalysts or timelines. Most other content restates public facts (revenue/EPS beats, value\u2011added services share, commercial payments share, analyst targets) or uses boilerplate moat and regulatory language. The valuation section applies conventional assumptions (WACC, revenue CAGR, buybacks, margin lift) without a novel driver or company-specific mechanism, triggering a cap at Fair. Decision relevance is limited to broad growth/margin framing; there is no unique, testable thesis (e.g., quantified commercial payments ramp, specific regulatory outcomes, or product/country catalysts) and minimal peer-specific angles. Overall, originality is modest: some synthesis is present, but generic restatements dominate and novel valuation drivers are absent.",
