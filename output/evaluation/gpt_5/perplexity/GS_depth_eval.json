    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates meaningful analytical depth through causal explanations and explicit, quantified assumptions. It links performance to business drivers, e.g., \u201cdriven by continued momentum\u201d and \u201cbenefited from increased client activity,\u201d and provides forward-looking assumptions such as \u201cWe project revenue CAGR of 4-6%\u201d and \u201cWe estimate normalized return on equity of 12-14%.\u201d Assumptions are modestly benchmarked with \u201cin line with historical performance and management targets,\u201d and valuation inputs include a \u201cweighted average cost of capital assumption of 8.5%.\u201d Data use is decent, with segment revenues, ROE, AUM, and fee trends supporting the narrative and a sum-of-the-parts fair value. However, the analysis lacks quantified sensitivity/scenario work: no ranges on WACC/terminal growth, no explicit EPS/NII/ROE impact under different market conditions, and no stress tests tied to M&A volumes or trading volatility. Counterpoints are mostly qualitative (regulatory scrutiny, market exposure) without numerical exploration. Actionable implications are present via the stated fair value relative to price (shares trading at a premium), but decision-relevant conditions are not quantified. Overall, mechanisms and assumptions are present and partly benchmarked, yet the absence of scenario/sensitivity limits the depth to Good rather than Excellent.",
