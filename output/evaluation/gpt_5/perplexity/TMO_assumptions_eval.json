    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are mostly explicit and proximate to forecasts: revenue to $49.6B by 2027 (5% CAGR), margin expansion to mid\u201120s, tax rate ~10.5%, WACC ~8.5%, terminal growth 3%, and valuation multiple normalization to 19\u201320x. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons are stated, with some ranges (e.g., $1\u20132B acquisitions annually). Consistency appears clean; figures reconcile across narrative and tables (e.g., FY24 EPS/margin, 2027 EPS ~27.7). However, justification is partial: several inputs (WACC, tax rate, terminal growth, multiple normalization, acquisition add-ons) lack strong evidence or peer/history citations beyond general market growth references. Critically, the report provides no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for material levers (revenue growth, margins, tax, WACC, terminal growth, or multiples), which triggers the hard cap at Fair. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific but not stress\u2011tested and only lightly justified, leaving the model\u2019s robustness under different conditions insufficiently evaluated.",
