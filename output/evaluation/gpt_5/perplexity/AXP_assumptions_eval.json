    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are mostly explicit and numerically stated in the \u201cFair Value and Profit Drivers,\u201d \u201cAppendix,\u201d and the forecast table, with ranges and horizons (e.g., WACC 9.5%, terminal growth 2.5%, 50\u2013100 bps margin expansion through 2027). However, justification is weak: figures lack support from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources beyond brief mentions (e.g., billed business growth), and key parameters like WACC, terminal growth, and valuation multiple are asserted without evidence. Specificity is partial\u2014many inputs have magnitudes and timeframes, but some are vague or context-free (e.g., \u201cnet revenue margins 10\u201311%\u201d without definition, \u201cstable NIM\u201d without quantification). Internal consistency is compromised by at least two numeric contradictions: FY2025E revenue declines versus stated 8\u201310% growth guidance, and the Appendix\u2019s 2025\u20132029 revenue CAGR (6.2%) conflicts with the model table (~7.9%). Stress testing is absent; sensitivities are only qualitative, with no quantified ranges or scenario analysis for revenue/NIM/margins/credit costs. Given multiple contradictions plus lack of quantified sensitivity on material drivers, the overall quality of assumptions is poor.",
