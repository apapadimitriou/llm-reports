    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s core modeling assumptions are largely explicit and concentrated in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section, the Financials Snapshot table, and the Appendix. Specificity is solid: it provides concrete magnitudes, units, and timeframes for product peak sales (Keytruda, Winrevair, Ohtuvayre), a quantified patent erosion path (35%/50%), margin trajectory, WACC (8.5%), and terminal growth (3%). However, justification is weak: the report does not tie these key inputs to multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources (e.g., WACC, LTG, peak sales, and erosion rates lack evidentiary backing). Internal consistency shows minor issues: the narrative states \u201cpatent cliff impact beginning 2028,\u201d while the table/footnote indicate growth \u201cthrough 2028\u201d with the drop evident in 2029, and Keytruda peaking in 2028 \u201cbefore biosimilar erosion.\u201d Sensitivity analysis is absent; there are no quantified scenario ranges for major drivers (revenue growth/erosion rates, WACC/LTG, margin path), triggering a hard cap at Fair. Several material inputs are missing or opaque (tax rate, share count/dilution path, capex/working capital underlying FCF), limiting auditability. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified, with minor consistency issues and no sensitivities.",
