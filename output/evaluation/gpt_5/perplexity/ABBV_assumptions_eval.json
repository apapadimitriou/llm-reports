    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are explicitly stated and proximal to the forecasts: revenue CAGR (7\u20138% to 2029), margin expansion (45\u201347%), WACC (7.5%), terminal growth (3%), and an EPS path ($10.12 in 2024 to $15\u201316 by 2029), plus a qualitative note on share count reduction. Specificity is decent for most inputs with magnitudes and horizons; however, share count is vague (\u201cmodest\u201d), and several material drivers (tax rate, capex, working capital, interest rate/debt schedule) are missing. Justification is weak: the revenue growth and product sales targets reference management guidance, but margin, WACC, terminal growth, and buyback/share count lack support from historical data, peers, or cited sources. Internal consistency appears clean\u2014no numeric contradictions with the narrative. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for major levers (e.g., Skyrizi/Rinvoq adoption, margin trajectory, WACC/terminal growth); only qualitative risk mentions. Under the decision rules, absence of quantified sensitivities caps the grade at Fair. Overall, assumptions are explicit and partially specific but thinly justified and incomplete.",
