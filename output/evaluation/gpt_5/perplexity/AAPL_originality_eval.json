    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains a mix of company detail and some interpretive analysis but leans heavily on generic restatements. It offers two decision-relevant syntheses: linking tariff escalation to a quantified margin impact (200\u2013300 bps) and tying EPS growth to buybacks and cash generation. It also advances one original thesis about Apple\u2019s privacy-first, on-device AI approach likely favoring hardware upgrade cycles over near-term services monetization, with WWDC flagged as a catalyst. However, several core sections repeat widely known points (Services at 21% offsetting iPhone deceleration; China exposure and Huawei competition; standard DCF inputs like WACC and terminal growth without a differentiated driver). Quantification is sporadic and largely sourced rather than derived, and peer contrasts are minimal. The valuation section is mostly boilerplate, aside from the tariff scenario. Given \u22653 generic/restated insights and limited company-specific mechanisms, actionability is modest. Under the hard caps, the presence of multiple generic restatements constrains the grade to Fair despite the few synthesized and thesis elements.",
