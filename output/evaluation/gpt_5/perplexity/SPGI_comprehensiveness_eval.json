    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections comprehensively: cover block and contents, analyst note, business description, strategy, bulls/bears, economic moat, valuation and drivers, risks, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, and sources. Valuation assumptions are explicit, with revenue CAGR, margin expansion, WACC, and an EPS bridge linking operating drivers to fair value. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits multiple sector-specific KPIs pertinent to financial data/ratings (e.g., index-linked AUM, ratings issuance volumes, ARR/NRR, and revenue mix), triggering a hard cap. Peer benchmarking is limited to qualitative duopoly mentions; no quantitative peer context or comparative metrics are provided. Evidence is cited throughout, but some claims are uncited or rely on outdated/mismatched sources (e.g., 2025 EPS supported by a 2021 source; 2024 FCF tied to a 2022 source), reducing consistency. There is noticeable repetition around IHS Markit synergies and macro headwinds across several sections with limited incremental detail. No scenario/sensitivity analysis is included. Overall, breadth is strong, linkage from drivers to valuation is present, but KPI omissions, sourcing issues, lack of peer benchmarking, and redundancy constrain comprehensiveness.",
