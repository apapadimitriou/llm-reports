    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally comprehensive, covering all headline sections: cover block, contents, analyst note, business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation & drivers, risk, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, appendix, and sources. Evidence integration is generally consistent, with in-text citations supporting most material claims and a sources list. Valuation includes explicit operating assumptions (revenue growth, margin expansion, FCF margins, WACC) and scenario cases in the appendix, linking drivers to a fair value range. However, the Financials Snapshot table is generic and omits multiple core SaaS KPIs (ARR, NRR/dollar-based net retention, billings, RPO/CRPO, subscription revenue mix), triggering the hard cap to Fair. Peer context exists (Microsoft, Salesforce), but formal peer benchmarking is missing. Redundancy is limited; recurring AI strategy themes add incremental depth across sections. Overall, breadth is strong, but the absence of sector-specific KPI tables and lack of peer benchmarking reduce comprehensiveness to Fair.",
