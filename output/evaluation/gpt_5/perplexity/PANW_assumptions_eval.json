    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation and forecast assumptions are mostly explicit and proximal to the sections they inform (Fair Value, Appendix, Financials Snapshot). Specificity is reasonable: revenue CAGR is stated as \u201c12\u201315%,\u201d margin trajectory \u201c27%\u219230%,\u201d WACC 9.5%, terminal growth 3%, tax 21%, and share count \u22122%/yr, with clear units and horizons. However, justification is weak: inputs like WACC, terminal growth, tax rate, share count decline, and the $800M CyberArk revenue addition lack cited sources, multi-year history, or peer benchmarks. Internal consistency suffers from a notable contradiction: the report says the CyberArk deal closes in FY26 but also attributes FY25 EPS acceleration to its impact. Sensitivity analysis is limited: a bull/bear price range is provided without quantifying changes to material drivers (growth, margins, WACC), so stress-testing is qualitative at best. Overall, while assumptions are stated and somewhat specific, they are thinly justified and not robustly stress-tested, with one contradiction capping the grade at Fair per the decision rules.",
