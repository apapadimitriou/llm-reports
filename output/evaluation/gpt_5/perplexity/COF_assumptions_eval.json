    "summary_reasoning": "The report states several material drivers explicitly and proximal to the valuation narrative (e.g., credit card revenue CAGR, NIM band, charge-offs, provisions, WACC, terminal growth, synergies). Specificity is generally solid: magnitudes, ranges, and horizons (mostly through 2027) are provided. However, justification is weak: most assumptions lack cited multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or sourced evidence beyond brief rationales (e.g., \u201creflecting historical performance\u201d without data), and unusual figures for a bank (e.g., 7.0\u20137.3% NIM) are not reconciled to peers. Internal consistency appears clean with no direct numeric contradictions between text and tables, though some metrics (e.g., operating margin for a bank) are unconventional without reconciliation. Crucially, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis linking key drivers (rates/NIM, credit costs, WACC, terminal growth, synergies) to valuation or target price impacts; ranges are presented as base-case inputs rather than stress tests. Given the lack of robust sensitivities and limited evidence-based justification, the assumptions quality fits Fair per the decision rules and hard caps.",
