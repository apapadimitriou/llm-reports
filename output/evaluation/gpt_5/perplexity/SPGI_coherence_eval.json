    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is broadly well-structured and readable, with a clear arc from Analyst Note through Strategy, Moat, Valuation, and Risks. It consistently references the Mobility spinoff, IHS Markit synergies, and secular tailwinds across multiple sections, which supports a connected narrative. Transitions are generally smooth, and terminology is used consistently. However, there are notable internal inconsistencies that undermine coherence. In Fair Value, the narrative asserts operating margins will \u201cgradually expand by 100\u2013200 bps,\u201d but the Financials Snapshot table shows margins falling in 2025 (39.3% to 37.5%) and then expanding by about 300 bps by 2029, which exceeds the stated expansion and conflicts with the \u201cgradual\u201d characterization. Additionally, temporal and citation alignment issues are present: Q2 2025 results are attributed to a source dated March 19, 2025, which cannot cover Q2, and market cap/price metrics are footnoted to a 2018 YCharts source. Despite these issues, sections do reference each other (e.g., risks echoed in Bears and Strategy), and the valuation logic is mostly linked to the stated assumptions. Due to the unaddressed assumptions-vs-table contradiction and time/citation mismatches, coherence is capped at fair under the guardrails.",
