    "summary_reasoning": "Key modeling inputs are mostly explicit and appear near the forecasts/valuation sections (Fair Value and Profit Drivers; Appendix). Specificity is partial: several assumptions include magnitudes (e.g., 3\u20134% revenue growth, 58% efficiency ratio, COE 9.5%, terminal growth 2%), but horizons are vague (\u201cmedium term\u201d) and operational linkages (e.g., NII/NIM, credit costs) are not quantified. Justification is weak: the report offers limited evidence, sparse citation of peer/industry benchmarks, and minimal reconciliation to multi-year history for core drivers (revenue CAGR, margin path, WACC/COE, terminal growth/multiples). Internal consistency shows a minor numeric conflict (EPS growth \u201c~12.7%\u201d vs table-implied ~11.9% for 2025), and fair value is asserted without transparent ties to the provided assumptions. Stress testing is absent\u2014no quantified sensitivities or scenario ranges are provided for material drivers (rates/NIM, credit costs, margins, growth), triggering the hard cap at Fair. Material drivers critical for a bank (NII/NIM, credit losses, tax rate, share count dilution/buybacks) are missing or qualitative only. Overall, the assumptions are listed and directionally relevant but under-justified, partly specified, and not stress-tested.",
