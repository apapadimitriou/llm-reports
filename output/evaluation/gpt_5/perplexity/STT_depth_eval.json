    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal links and explicit, quantified assumptions tied to forecasts. It explains drivers such as fee growth and margin expansion (e.g., \u201cdriven by robust asset flows\u201d and \u201chave expanded pre-tax margins to 28.1%\u201d), and lays out key valuation inputs (\u201cRevenue projections assume 4-6% annual fee revenue growth,\u201d \u201cOperating leverage assumptions incorporate 2-3% annual expense growth,\u201d \u201cweighted average cost of capital estimate of 9.2%\u201d). It also provides a quantified EPS bridge (\u201cnormalized market appreciation contributing $0.15-0.20 annually\u201d), enhancing inference quality and decision relevance. Data use is extensive with multiple figures across revenue, margins, AUM/AUC, and capital returns. However, assumptions lack benchmarking against peers or history, and the report omits quantified sensitivities or scenario analysis (e.g., rate or market drawdown impacts on NII/fees), limiting uncertainty treatment. Counterpoints are discussed qualitatively (\u201cRisks include potential margin pressure\u201d) without stress tests. Actionable implications are present via the fair value ($108.42) and Price/FVE (1.03x), but conditional decision rules (e.g., outcomes under rate changes) are missing. Overall, explicit mechanisms and quantification are strong, yet the absence of quantified scenarios/sensitivities constrains the grade to Good.\n\nExcerpts: \u201cdriven by robust asset flows\u201d; \u201chave expanded pre-tax margins to 28.1%\u201d; \u201cRevenue projections assume 4-6% annual fee revenue growth\u201d; \u201cOperating leverage assumptions incorporate 2-3% annual expense growth\u201d; \u201cweighted average cost of capital estimate of 9.2%\u201d; \u201cnormalized market appreciation contributing $0.15-0.20 annually\u201d.",
