    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation inputs are stated explicitly and proximate to the forecasts: the appendix lists revenue CAGR (2024\u20132029), terminal growth, WACC, tax rate, and target operating margin, and the financials table provides multi\u2011year projections. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons are provided for material drivers. Internal consistency appears clean, with table values (e.g., 2024A EPS $10.26; op margin path to ~67%) aligning with narrative claims. However, justification is limited: WACC (8.5%), terminal growth (3%), tax rate (24%), and the 67% margin target lack support from cited sources, peer benchmarks, or a multi\u2011year historical rationale beyond brief mentions of strong margins and revenue records. The revenue CAGR (6.8%) is not triangulated against historical multi\u2011year growth or peer exchanges. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for major levers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth, tax), which triggers a hard cap at Fair. Share count/buyback effects are referenced qualitatively without specific modeling assumptions. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified and not stress\u2011tested.",
