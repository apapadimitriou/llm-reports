    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation inputs are mostly explicit and proximate to the forecasts: revenue CAGR (5\u20137%), WACC (8.5%), terminal growth (2.5\u20133.0%), tax rate (25%), FCF conversion (75% of EBIT), and a margin path (>17% by 2029). Specificity is solid: ranges, units (% and $), and horizons (next five years, terminal) are provided, and tables give multi-year revenue, margin, EPS, and FCF trajectories. Justification is partial: revenue growth references management guidance; margin expansion cites operational efficiency; FCF conversion notes historical performance, but WACC, terminal growth, and tax rate lack source-backed evidence or peer/market benchmarks. Internal consistency has one numeric contradiction: 2029 FCF is stated as \u201c~$1.6B\u201d in text while the table shows $1.76B. Sensitivity analysis is limited; while a valuation range ($275\u2013$295) is given, drivers (growth, margins, discount rate) are not quantified in scenarios, triggering the hard cap at Fair. Some material drivers (share count, capex) remain opaque. Overall, assumptions are clearly stated and specific, but justification and scenario rigor are insufficient and the FCF discrepancy reduces consistency.",
