    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and mostly smooth prose, moving from Analyst Note through Strategy, Moat, Valuation, Risks, and Capital Allocation, with reasonable cross-references (e.g., AI strategy feeding into AWS growth assumptions and advertising momentum reflected in margins). The Financials Snapshot ties back to the narrative\u2019s margin expansion and investment cycle themes, and the Bulls/Bears section echoes earlier points on market share, AI, and regulatory risk. However, coherence is undermined by notable citation/date misalignments and at least one material internal contradiction. Q2 2025 performance claims are repeatedly sourced to items with incompatible dates (e.g., MarketBeat 2021; Harvest Group 2023), and an \u201cAlphaSense Q2 2025\u201d analysis dated February 14, 2025, cannot plausibly pertain to Q2 results. In valuation, EPS growth is said to be supported by share repurchase programs, while Capital Allocation states the company emphasizes reinvestment over dividends or repurchases\u2014an unaddressed tension that affects the base-case drivers. There are minor consistency rough edges, such as differing AWS growth rates (17% vs. 19%) without explicit period reconciliation, and a bold capex figure (>$100 billion) introduced without integration into the modeled FCF trajectory beyond a brief acknowledgement. These issues require reader effort to reconcile, warranting a fair grade and an auto-downgrade for temporal inaccuracies and narrative contradictions.",
