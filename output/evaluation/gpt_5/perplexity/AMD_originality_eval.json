    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly restated or paraphrased content from public sources (quarterly beat/miss, export-control impact, x86 share gains, AI accelerator roadmap) and a standard DCF with conventional assumptions (mid-teens CAGR, mid-20s margins, 8.5% WACC, 3% terminal growth) without introducing novel valuation drivers. I found one weak synthesis that links the AI PC refresh, Dell partnership, and H2\u201925 timing to a commercial catalyst; otherwise, the analysis leans on boilerplate formulations about diversified portfolios and execution. The export-control quantification ($1.5B and related charges) is cited rather than interpreted into differentiated margin/NOPAT trajectories or customer-level exposure, limiting originality. There are no original theses with clear mechanisms, quantified implications, or monitorable catalysts (e.g., ROCm maturation vs CUDA lock-in, MI350 die/yield constraints affecting gross margin, or hyperscaler purchase commitments). Peer-specific contrasts are largely absent, and risks are a generic laundry list. Decision relevance exists in the fair value call and a few timing notes, but interpretive depth is limited. Given \u22653 copied/generic insights and a valuation section lacking novel drivers, originality caps at Fair.",
