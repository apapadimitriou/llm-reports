    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and generally coherent narrative, with consistent use of key terms such as net interest income (NII), CET1 ratio, and segment descriptions. There is solid connective tissue across sections: NII guidance appears in the Analyst Note, Strategy & Outlook, Fair Value, and Risks, helping the argument read as a unified thesis. Transitions are mostly smooth, and the Fair Value section logically bridges assumptions to projected EPS and valuation multiples. However, there are notable internal and temporal inconsistencies that disrupt coherence. The opening claims \u201csecond-quarter 2025 results with EPS of $0.89\u201d conflict with the report date (2025-07-02), as Q2 results are typically mid-July; this recency claim is also supported by Source [5], dated 2021, which does not align with the 2025 EPS claim. Additionally, the stated dividend yield (2.2%) does not reconcile with the concurrently stated $0.28 quarterly dividend and $46.03 share price, implying a higher yield. Several citations for current metrics (e.g., market cap, stock price) reference older sources, creating temporal noise. Despite these issues, sections reference one another reasonably well, and the valuation narrative acknowledges cyclical risks, which limits the downgrade to fair rather than poor.",
