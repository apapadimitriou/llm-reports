    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal linkages and explicit, quantified assumptions. It connects performance to drivers (e.g., rare disease strength and MS erosion) and ties forecasts to mechanisms such as mix shift and cost programs. Notably, it specifies assumptions like \u201coperating margin expansion to 25-27% over the medium term,\u201d \u201cWACC: 7.76%,\u201d and \u201cMS franchise decline rate: 6% annually,\u201d and outlines revenue drivers \u201cdriven by SKYCLARYS expansion.\u201d It also provides quantified ranges, for instance \u201cLeqembi collaboration revenue could reach $200-400 million annually,\u201d and conditional valuation implications such as \u201cupside potential to 18-20x multiple.\u201d However, while ranges are provided, the report lacks explicit sensitivity or scenario analysis linking variable changes to EPS or fair value (e.g., no valuation impact if MS decline accelerates or Leqembi underperforms). Benchmarking of key assumptions is limited: WACC and terminal growth are stated but not justified against peer or macro references. Uncertainty is discussed in Bulls/Bears and Risk sections, but downside impacts remain qualitative. Actionable implications are present (implied upside and conditions for multiple expansion). Overall, the report meets criteria for Good: mechanism-rich narrative with explicit, quantified assumptions, but short of Excellent due to absence of quantified scenario/sensitivity analysis and limited benchmarking of assumptions. Key excerpts: \u201cdriven by SKYCLARYS expansion\u201d; \u201coperating margin expansion to 25-27% over the medium term\u201d; \u201cMS franchise decline rate: 6% annually\u201d; \u201cLeqembi collaboration revenue could reach $200-400 million annually\u201d; \u201cupside potential to 18-20x multiple.\u201d",
