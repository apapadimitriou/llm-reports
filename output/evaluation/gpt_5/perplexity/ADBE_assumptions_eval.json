    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key modeling assumptions are explicit and proximal to the forecasts they inform, with clear magnitudes, units, and horizons. Revenue growth is specified by segment (Digital Media 8\u201310%, Document Cloud 15\u201318%, Digital Experience 10\u201312%), margin trajectory is quantified (to 47\u201348% by FY29), and valuation inputs (WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 3.5%) are stated. Sensitivities are present via base/bull/bear ranges for several material levers (Revenue CAGR, operating margin, AI revenue mix, subscriber growth, WACC, terminal growth), providing partial quantified stress tests. Internal consistency is generally clean; figures reconcile with the Financials Snapshot and guidance midpoints. However, justification is partial: most assumptions are supported qualitatively (management guidance, SaaS scalability) rather than with multi-year peer benchmarks or cited sources within the report. Some material parameters (tax rate, capex/FCF drivers, share count trajectory) are missing or opaque, and valuation inputs like WACC and terminal growth lack sourced evidence. Overall, the assumptions are explicit, specific, and mostly consistent with partial sensitivities, but justification depth and coverage gaps prevent an Excellent grade.",
