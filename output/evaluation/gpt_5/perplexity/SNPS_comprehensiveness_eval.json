    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all headline sections (cover, contents, executive summary, business description, strategy, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, financials, ESG, appendix, sources) with reasonable narrative depth. Valuation includes explicit assumptions (growth, margins, synergies, discount rate, terminal growth) and links operating drivers to a DCF-based fair value, supplemented by a P/E cross-check. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits multiple sector-appropriate KPIs for software/EDA (e.g., ARR, RPO/backlog, billings, bookings, renewal rates, segment mix), triggering the hard cap. Peer benchmarking is absent beyond passing mentions (e.g., Cadence), and scenario/sensitivity analysis is limited to a single range without structured cases. Evidence integration is mixed: many claims are cited, but several material assertions (ESG metrics, workforce composition) lack in-text citations. Some redundancy appears with repeated mentions of the Ansys acquisition and China export restrictions across sections without incremental analysis. These gaps constrain comprehensiveness despite broad topical coverage.",
