    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report has a clear structure and generally coherent narrative, moving from recent performance to strategy, valuation, and risks. Transitions are mostly smooth, and sections reference each other (e.g., volume-driven growth in Strategy is echoed in Valuation; volatility and regulatory risks are revisited in Risks). However, there are material coherence issues that prevent a higher grade. First, there is a temporal inconsistency: the report date is 2025-04-23, yet it asserts that Q2 2025 EPS of $2.96 was reported, which would be impossible as Q2 had not concluded by that date. Relatedly, some citations used to support 2025 data are dated 2021/2022, undermining temporal and source alignment. Second, there is an internal contradiction between the stated revenue growth assumption and the projections table: the Appendix sets a 6.8% revenue CAGR (and Valuation mentions 6-8%), while the Financials Snapshot implies a roughly 5.8% CAGR from 2024 to 2029, without reconciliation. Additionally, the report references sources [15] and [17], but these are missing from the Sources list, weakening citation coherence. On the positive side, Bulls/Bears are reasonably reconciled with the base case via the Risks section acknowledging volume dependence and competition. Despite strong organization and mostly consistent terminology, the time inaccuracies and assumption-table mismatch necessitate a fair grade.",
