    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most headline sections comprehensively: cover block, contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk, Capital Allocation, Financials, ESG, and Appendix. The Valuation section reasonably links operating drivers (card revenue growth, network revenues, NIM expansion, synergies, charge-off assumptions, WACC/terminal growth) to the fair value outcome. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic, lacking multiple sector-appropriate KPIs for a bank/card issuer (e.g., NIM/NII, loan loss provisions, CET1, net charge-offs, purchase volume), triggering the KPI hard cap. In-text bracket citations ([1], [5], etc.) are present but the Sources list does not enumerate them, leaving several material claims uncited, which also caps the grade. Peer benchmarking is absent beyond qualitative mentions of Visa/Mastercard/AmEx, and there is no scenario/sensitivity analysis. Redundancy is limited; while the Discover acquisition is referenced across sections, it generally adds new context each time. Overall, strong coverage of sections and linkage in valuation, but insufficient KPI detail in the snapshot, missing peer analysis, and inconsistent sourcing reduce the comprehensiveness.",
