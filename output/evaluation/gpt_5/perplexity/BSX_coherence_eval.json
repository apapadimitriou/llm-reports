    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and generally smooth narrative flow, with sections that often reference guidance, margins, and product drivers consistently across Analyst Note, Strategy & Outlook, and Valuation. The Financials Snapshot aligns with the stated 2025 EPS guidance and margin expansion trajectory, and the fair value section ties assumptions (growth, WACC, terminal values) to drivers like FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN. However, material internal contradictions undermine coherence. Most notably, the Analyst Note asserts FARAPULSE generated over $1 billion in sales in 2024 while simultaneously stating the PFA market\u2019s total addressable market has grown to exceed $500 million, an irreconcilable mismatch. The Business Description also contradicts itself on segment definitions, saying Cardiovascular encompasses \u201crhythm and neuro,\u201d while MedSurg covers \u201cneuromodulation,\u201d creating confusion about where neuro/neuromodulation belongs. Capital Allocation claims free cash flow averaged 12.5% of revenue, which conflicts with the table\u2019s implied ratios (roughly 14\u201315% for 2022\u20132025E). Bulls/Bears are not explicitly reconciled with the base-case valuation (no sensitivity or downside integration to tariffs/competition), and two sections (Bulls/Bears, Appendix) read as bullet dumps without connective tissue. Citations occasionally feel misaligned (e.g., TAM claim), further contributing to internal noise. Overall, the report is understandable but requires reader effort to resolve tensions, warranting a fair grade with auto-downgrades applied.",
