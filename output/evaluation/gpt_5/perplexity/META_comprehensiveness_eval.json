    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections with a clear contents page, including Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, and Appendix. The Valuation section provides a DCF framework with explicit operating assumptions (ad revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, WACC, terminal growth) and a qualitative bridge from drivers to fair value, but it lacks scenario/sensitivity analysis. Evidence integration is weak: while many data points carry bracketed references, the Sources section does not list or map actual citations, leaving multiple material claims effectively uncited. The Financials Snapshot is generic (revenue, margins, EPS, FCF, ROIC) and omits core sector KPIs for social media/online advertising (e.g., MAUs/DAUs trend table, ARPU, ad impressions and price per ad). Peer benchmarking is limited to qualitative mentions of TikTok/X without structured comparisons. Some redundancy appears (capex guidance and TikTok competition repeated across Analyst Note, Strategy, Bears, Risk, and Capital Allocation with modest incremental depth). Given the missing sector KPIs in the snapshot and unresolved citations, the comprehensiveness is capped at Fair despite otherwise broad section coverage.",
