    "summary_reasoning": "The report states several key modeling inputs explicitly in the Appendix and Fair Value sections (revenue CAGR, WACC, terminal growth, terminal margin, tax rate) and aligns near-term forecasts with 2025 guidance in the Financials Snapshot, so explicitness and basic specificity are present. However, justification is weak: long-term drivers like WACC (8.5%), terminal growth (3%), terminal operating margin (21%), and tax rate (22%) lack supporting evidence from history, peers, or cited sources. Specificity is partial\u2014units and time horizons are given, but important levers (capex/working capital, share count/dilution, segment mix) are omitted. Internal consistency is compromised by a numeric contradiction in the narrative (PFA market size vs FARAPULSE sales), and there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers (e.g., growth, margins, WACC, tariffs), which violates the stress-testing criterion. Together\u2014one contradiction plus no sensitivities\u2014triggers the hard-cap downgrade to Poor despite some clear assumptions. To improve, the report needs sourced justification for discount rate, terminal parameters, and margins; inclusion of capex/FCF bridge and share count assumptions; and robust quantified sensitivities showing valuation and target-price impacts under alternative growth, margin, and WACC scenarios.",
