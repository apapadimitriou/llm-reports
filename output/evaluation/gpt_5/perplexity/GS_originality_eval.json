    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains ample company detail but offers little in the way of unique, decision-relevant interpretation. Most statements restate public data (EPS/revenue beats, #1 M&A rank, AWM AuS, dividend/buyback policy) or rely on boilerplate framing (moat, leadership, reduced volatility from fee revenues). I identified one weak synthesis\u2014linking the strategic pivot away from lower-return businesses to AWM fee growth\u2014but it lacks quantification, peer contrast, or catalysts. The valuation section uses a standard SOTP with normalized ROE and WACC assumptions and does not introduce novel drivers (e.g., specific IB backlog conversion timing, trading mix vs. VaR/vol metrics, or carry realization cadence in alternatives), triggering a hard cap at Fair. Decision relevance is limited: while a $650 fair value is specific, the mechanisms are generic and not company-distinct. No original theses with clear causal links, quantified implications, or timelines are presented. Boilerplate phrasing is prevalent. Overall, the piece reads as a competent recap rather than a source of new insights.",
