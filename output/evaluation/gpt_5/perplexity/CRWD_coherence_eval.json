    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure with coherent sections (Analyst Note \u2192 Strategy/Outlook \u2192 Moat \u2192 Valuation \u2192 Risks \u2192 Capital Allocation) and mostly consistent terminology (ARR, Next-Gen SIEM, operating margin). Transitions within sections are generally smooth, and there is some cross-referencing\u2014e.g., outage impacts mentioned in the Analyst Note are revisited in Risks, and the valuation assumptions align with the Appendix (WACC 9%, terminal margins). However, temporal and citation alignment issues detract from coherence. The Cover Block\u2019s market cap and analyst price target figures rely on sources dated 2021 and 2022, which do not credibly support 2025 values; this is a time-inaccuracy and citation mismatch. The Financials Snapshot cites sources that are unlikely to fully underpin the detailed historical/reported numbers, weakening internal support. While Bulls/Bears are complemented by scenario ranges in the Appendix, the base-case valuation does not explicitly reconcile litigation and reputational risks\u2019 impact on multiples beyond general caution, though the overall narrative does acknowledge them. There are no glaring contradictions between narrative and tables, and fiscal Q1 2026 references align with the June 2025 report date. Given these strengths and the notable temporal/citation issues, the report is understandable but internally noisy, warranting a fair grade with a hard cap due to time inaccuracies.",
