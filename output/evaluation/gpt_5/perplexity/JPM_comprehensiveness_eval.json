    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections, including cover block, contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, ESG, and Sources. The valuation section reasonably links operating drivers (loan growth, NIM stabilization, efficiency ratio, provisions) to earnings and a P/E multiple, and briefly notes sensitivity ranges. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks core bank KPIs (NIM/NII, provisions, CET1, charge-offs, deposits), triggering a hard cap at Fair. Evidence integration is uneven: while many in-text citations are provided, several are outdated or mismatched (e.g., a 2021 source used for 2025 earnings) and some material facts (price, market cap, dividend track record) are uncited. Peer benchmarking is absent, and scenario analysis is mentioned only superficially without a dedicated section or tables. There is minor redundancy where credit normalization and NII headwinds are reiterated across Analyst Note and Risk without additional depth. Overall, breadth is solid, but sector-appropriate KPI detail in the financial tables and tighter, consistent sourcing are necessary for a higher grade.",
