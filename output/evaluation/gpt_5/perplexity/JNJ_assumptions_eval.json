    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation inputs are explicitly stated and proximal to the forecasts (revenue CAGR, margin path, discount rate, terminal growth, tax rate), with clear magnitudes, units, and horizons. Specificity is solid: the report provides quantified ranges (100\u2013150 bp margin expansion) and point assumptions (2.5% terminal growth; 8.2% discount rate; 21% tax rate). However, justification is weak: the 4.5% revenue CAGR and margin expansion are framed as conservative relative to management guidance but lack supporting multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources tying directly to the chosen figures. The discount rate and terminal growth are unreferenced, and the R&D intensity shift to 25% of Innovative Medicine revenue is not evidenced. Internal consistency has a notable contradiction: the Economic Moat section cites a 5.9% WACC while the DCF uses an 8.2% discount rate without reconciliation. Sensitivities are qualitative only; there are no quantified scenario or sensitivity analyses on material drivers (e.g., revenue erosion from Stelara, margin bands, discount rate or terminal growth impacts). Several important drivers remain opaque or missing (capex, share count trajectory, working capital). Per decision rules, the lack of quantified sensitivities and the contradiction cap the grade at Fair.",
