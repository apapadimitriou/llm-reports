    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: a cover block and contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, ESG, Financials Snapshot, Appendix/Glossary, and Sources. Depth is generally proportional across qualitative sections, with coherent discussions of MS erosion, rare-disease growth, and Alzheimer\u2019s competition. The valuation section does link explicit operating drivers (MS decline, SKYCLARYS/salanersen peak sales, Leqembi collaboration revenue, margin expansion, WACC) to the fair value narrative. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic; it omits core biopharma KPIs (e.g., product-level revenue tables, pipeline timelines/PoS, patient counts or share), triggering a hard cap to Fair. Evidence integration is inconsistent: many material claims are tied to outdated or ambiguous sources (e.g., 2022 intrinsic value/WACC; a 2021-dated MarketBeat item for 2025 earnings; a 2018 MacroTrends link labeled 2010\u20132025), which further caps the grade at Fair. Peer context is limited to qualitative mentions (no benchmarking tables). There is some redundancy (repeated salanersen peak-sales point across multiple sections) without added depth. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is absent. Overall, while the structure is comprehensive and linkages are present, missing sector KPIs in the snapshot and reliance on dated citations prevent a Good grade.",
