    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: cover/contents, analyst note, business description, strategy & outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, and appendix with sources. Valuation assumptions are explicit and linked to operating drivers (growth, margins, WACC, asset-level contribution), and a base/bull/bear assumption table provides light scenario context. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks core biopharma KPIs (product-level revenue tables, R&D as % of sales, LOE/patent timelines, clinical milestone schedule), triggering the KPI hard cap. Peer benchmarking is absent. Evidence is generally cited, but at least two material items rely on outdated or questionable sourcing (e.g., Q2 2025 EPS/revenue tied to a 2021 link; very old P/E source) and several headline facts (price, market cap) are uncited. There is some redundancy around Horizon acquisition and MariTide across multiple sections without additional depth. Capital allocation and risk coverage are reasonably detailed. Overall, breadth is good, but missing sector KPIs in the snapshot and inconsistent sourcing cap the grade at Fair.",
