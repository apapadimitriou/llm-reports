    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report makes most key drivers explicit and proximal to forecasts, especially in the Fair Value/Profit Drivers section and the Appendix, with clear magnitudes, ranges, and horizons (e.g., revenue CAGR, payment volume CAGR, operating margin target, WACC, terminal growth, buybacks). Specificity is solid: units and timeframes are stated, and several operational sub-drivers (value-added services growth) are quantified. However, justification is weak-to-partial. While some narrative ties to pre-pandemic cross-border trends and segment mix, major valuation inputs (WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 3.0%, operating margin path 61.5%) lack evidence from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources. Internal consistency suffers a notable contradiction: \u201chigh-50%\u201d operating margin guidance conflicts with the 61.5% target and the 60%+ margin trajectory shown in forecasts. Sensitivity analysis is absent; risks are mentioned qualitatively without quantified scenarios or valuation impacts. Per decision rules, the lack of quantified sensitivities hard-caps the grade at Fair, and the unresolved margin contradiction also enforces a Fair cap. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific but under-justified, with one contradiction and no stress testing.",
