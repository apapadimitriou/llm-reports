    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s key inputs are mostly explicit and proximate to the valuation section (fee revenue and management fee growth ranges, expense growth, margin trajectory, WACC, terminal growth). Specificity is solid: ranges, units, and time horizons are stated, and the EPS bridge quantifies contributions. However, justification is partial: while some figures are referenced to recent results (e.g., Q4/Q1 margins/fee trends), core valuation parameters like WACC (9.2%) and terminal growth (2.5%) lack sourcing or peer/market evidence. Major banking drivers (NII/NIM path, tax rate, credit costs, capex) are absent or opaque, limiting robustness. Internal consistency appears clean with no contradictions between narrative and tables. Sensitivity is limited to ranges on a few drivers and EPS component bands; there is no quantified scenario analysis showing valuation or target impact across material levers. Given partial justification and limited stress-testing, the assumptions quality aligns with Fair under the decision rules.",
