    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s key modeling inputs are largely explicit and proximal to the valuation discussion (e.g., 2025 revenue midpoint, segment revenue ranges, margin targets, and DCF parameters like WACC and terminal growth). Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and time horizons are supplied for major drivers (COVID and RSV revenue ranges through 2027, peak oncology sales, operating expense path, peak operating margin, and long-term gross margin). However, justification is only partial: aside from citing management\u2019s 2025 revenue guidance, most assumptions (RSV uptake, oncology peak sales, WACC, terminal growth, pipeline success rates, peak margin) lack grounding in historical data, peer benchmarks, or sourced evidence. Internal consistency has a notable numeric issue: the stated opex reduction target of $1.4\u20131.7B by 2027 conflicts with the modeled path from ~$5.5B to $4.0\u20134.3B (a $1.2\u20131.5B reduction). Sensitivity analysis is absent; while some ranges are given for revenues, there is no quantified scenario/sensitivity framework tying these to valuation or target price, triggering the hard cap at Fair. Important drivers like tax rate, share count/dilution, capex, and working capital are missing or opaque, further limiting auditable rigor.",
