    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely explicit and proximate to the forecasts: the report states WACC (8.4%), terminal growth (3.0%), long-term margin (35%), segment CAGRs (Search 7%, Cloud 28%), and near-term growth ranges (Search 6\u20138%, YouTube 10\u201312%, Cloud 25\u201330% to 2027) with units and horizons. Specificity is solid. However, justification is weak: major valuation parameters (WACC, terminal growth, margin trajectory) lack support from historical data, peer benchmarks, or cited sources, and the segment growth rates are not tied to market share/industry context. Internal consistency appears clean; numbers reconcile across narrative and the financial table. Sensitivity analysis is mentioned only at the fair value level ($185\u2013$235) without quantified drivers (e.g., how revenue growth, margins, or WACC shifts move valuation), limiting stress-testing quality. Several material drivers are missing or opaque, notably tax rate, share count/buybacks, working capital, D&A, and capex trajectory beyond the single 2025 figure. Given weak justification and limited, non-robust sensitivities, the assumptions quality meets the Fair standard rather than Good.",
