    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: cover block and contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. The proportional depth is generally solid, and the valuation section provides explicit operating assumptions (AWS growth/margins, retail growth/margins, WACC, terminal growth) that link drivers to the fair value estimate. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic, focusing on revenue, margins, EPS, FCF, and ROIC, and omits multiple sector-specific KPIs critical for an Internet Retail/Cloud hybrid (e.g., AWS revenue and margin, Ad revenue growth, segment operating income, Prime subs, 3P mix). This triggers the KPI hard cap. Evidence integration is inconsistent: several material figures (Q2 2025 revenue/EPS; Q3 2025 guidance) are tied to outdated or mismatched sources, and many tabled metrics lack explicit sourcing, invoking the uncited/outdated hard cap as well. Peer/industry context is mentioned (Walmart, Microsoft, Google Cloud), but formal peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis are absent. Some repetition of AI investment themes appears across multiple sections without much incremental depth. Net impact: good structural coverage and reasonable linkage from drivers to valuation, but capped at Fair due to missing KPIs in the snapshot and citation issues.",
