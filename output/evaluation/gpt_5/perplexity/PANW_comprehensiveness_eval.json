    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected equity research sections: cover block and contents, analyst note, business description, strategy and outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation with drivers, risks, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, appendix, and sources. Depth is generally appropriate, with solid operating context (platformization, ARR, RPO, SASE) and a clear valuation framework linked to revenue/margin drivers. Evidence integration is strong overall, with in-text citations throughout and a comprehensive sources list. Scenario analysis (bull/bear) is present, but peer benchmarking is absent beyond a brief mention of Wiz, limiting industry context. The principal gap is the Financials Snapshot: while it provides multi-year revenue, EPS, FCF, operating margin, and ROIC, it omits core SaaS/cybersecurity KPIs like ARR, NRR, billings, and RPO, triggering a hard cap at Fair. A few material claims (buybacks, debt characterization) lack citations. Redundancy is minimal; recurring themes (platformization, CyberArk) add new facets across sections. Overall, the report is structurally comprehensive but falls short on sector KPI presentation in the financials table and peer benchmarking.",
