    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key assumptions are mostly explicit and proximate to the forecasts: revenue CAGR (\u201c8\u201310%\u201d), margin range (\u201c6\u20137%\u201d), WACC (7.5%), terminal growth (3%), tax rate (25%), and a specialty volume growth range (\u201c10\u201315%\u201d). Specificity is solid (percentages, ranges, multi\u2011year horizons), and most figures reconcile to the Financials Snapshot. However, justification is weak: there is minimal evidence tied to multi\u2011year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources for WACC, terminal growth, tax rate, or margin trajectory. A numeric inconsistency exists between the stated revenue CAGR (8\u201310% for 2025\u20132027) and the table\u2019s implied CAGR (~7.3%). Sensitivity/stress testing is limited: while two drivers are given as ranges (revenue CAGR and specialty volume growth), there is no quantified scenario analysis linking these ranges to valuation/target or EPS. Material drivers like share count/buybacks and capex/FCF drivers are not explicitly modeled. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified, with minor internal inconsistency and limited sensitivity, warranting a Fair grade.",
