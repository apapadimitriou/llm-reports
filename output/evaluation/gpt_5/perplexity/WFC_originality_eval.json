    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains one clear synthesis\u2014linking the Fed\u2019s asset-cap removal to near-term trading revenue benefits via expanded balance sheet capacity\u2014while most other points restate public information (CRE exposure, dividend/buyback plans, branch renovations, and management guidance). The valuation section relies on standard drivers (NII recovery, NIM stabilization around 2.7%, fee growth, efficiency ratio to 65%) without introducing a novel mechanism (e.g., deposit beta dynamics, duration/hedging impacts), triggering a hard cap at Fair. Decision relevance is moderate, with actionable mentions of a Q3 2025 dividend increase and CRE charge-off risk, but lacks quantified causal pathways, peer comparisons, or specific catalysts beyond the asset-cap removal. Overall, company detail is present but framed generically, with limited original theses and minimal peer-specific analysis. With \u22653 insights classified as generic/restated and no novel valuation drivers, the originality does not reach Good. The single synthesis is insufficient to elevate the grade given the preponderance of boilerplate sector themes and restated data.",
