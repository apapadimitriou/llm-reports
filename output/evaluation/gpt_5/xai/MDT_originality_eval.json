    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains no clear syntheses or original theses. Nearly all statements reiterate company press releases (innovation-led growth; raised guidance; segment strength) without adding causal mechanisms, quantification, or peer-specific contrasts. There are no numbers, units, or modeled implications (e.g., margin trajectory, revenue mix shifts, approval timelines tied to revenue ramps). The only \u201ccatalyst\u201d cited is a generic upcoming earnings date, which is not decision-relevant without a thesis on what to watch or how outcomes affect valuation. The valuation and financial sections are entirely N/A, and there is no novel driver or mechanism presented. Risk discussion is boilerplate (regulatory approvals could impact timelines) and not company-distinct. As a result, decision relevance is effectively zero, and the hard cap applies: with zero synthesis/original theses and a valuation section lacking any novel driver, the report merits a Poor grade for originality.",
