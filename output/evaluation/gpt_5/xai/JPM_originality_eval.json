    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains no clear syntheses or original theses. Most content repeats public headlines (Q2 beat, raised NII guidance, trading/investment banking strength) and boilerplate framing (scale, wide moat, diversification). The valuation relies on a standard DCF with generic drivers (4% revenue CAGR, margin expansion to 38%, terminal growth 3%, WACC 9%) without unique mechanisms (e.g., deposit betas, duration gap, funding mix changes) or company-specific causal links to margins or ROE trajectory. While there are a few quantified elements\u2014the $220 fair value target and a rate-cut sensitivity of 5\u201310%\u2014these are not tied to novel, decision-relevant insights and lack catalysts/timelines. Company-specific angles (e.g., First Republic integration) are mentioned but unquantified and labeled \u201cinsufficient data,\u201d offering no distinctive peer comparison or actionable thesis. Given zero synthesis or original theses and a generic valuation section, the report\u2019s originality is poor under the decision rules.",
