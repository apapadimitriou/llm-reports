    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear overall arc\u2014from the Analyst Note through strategy, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, and a financials table\u2014and most sections use consistent terminology (e.g., wide moat, medium uncertainty, margin expansion to 45% by 2027). There is good cross-referencing: the margin expansion claim appears in both the Analyst Note and Fair Value sections, and the uncertainty rating aligns with the Risk & Uncertainty discussion and the glossary definition. The Financials Snapshot supports the narrative forecasts (2029 revenue \u2248 $20B; EPS progression; margin trajectory). However, coherence is undermined by two material issues. First, a temporal mismatch: the report is dated July 2, 2025, but the Analyst Note treats Q2 2025 results reported July 31/August 1 as already happened, creating a time-inaccurate \u201crecency\u201d claim. Second, a core valuation contradiction: the Analyst Note says the $550 fair value implies a forward P/E of 30x, while the Fair Value section and the forecasts imply ~46x on FY2025 EPS of $12.00, which the table corroborates. A minor tension persists in the CAGR base year (FY2024\u20132029 vs 2025\u20132029 in the Appendix), though the modeled revenues align. Overall language is clear, and most transitions are adequate, but the unaddressed valuation contradiction and temporal inconsistency require a downgrade to fair under the guardrails.",
