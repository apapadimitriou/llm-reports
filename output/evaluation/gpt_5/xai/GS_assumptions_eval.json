    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report states several key modeling inputs near the valuation (revenue CAGR, margin, WACC, terminal growth, and share count) and provides a financial forecast table. Specificity: Many inputs include magnitudes and horizons (e.g., \u201c2025\u20132029\u201d CAGR, 30\u201331% margins, WACC 9%, terminal growth 3%), but some remain vague (no tax rate, only a -$1 EPS effect). Justification: Rationale is weak/partial\u2014assumptions are loosely tied to Q1/Q2 2025 trends and a beta/risk-free rate mention, with no peer benchmarking or multi-year historical analysis; several sources are cited but not used to substantiate the actual parameter values. Consistency: There are at least two numeric contradictions: (1) margin \u201caveraging 30%\u201d vs the appendix \u201cAvg. Op. Margin 30.5%,\u201d and (2) the EPS bridge math (40 + 8 + 3 - 1) totals 50, not the stated 48. These unresolved conflicts undermine internal coherence. Sensitivity: No quantitative sensitivity/scenario analyses are provided for material drivers (revenue/trading, margins, WACC, terminal growth, buybacks), beyond a generic \u00b120% uncertainty. Given multiple contradictions and absence of quantified sensitivities, the assumptions do not meet the bar for Good and fall to Poor per the decision rules.",
