    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most headline sections (cover, contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation, Risk, Capital Allocation, Financials, ESG, Appendix, Sources), but many are skeletal. The Financials Snapshot lacks multi-year history (shows \u201cInsufficient data\u201d for 2022\u20132024) and omits core exchange KPIs (e.g., ADV, RPC, open interest) in the table, triggering a cap at Fair. Valuation provides assumptions (revenue CAGR, margins, WACC, EPS bridge) and loosely ties drivers to outcomes, but detail is thin and not transparently linked to sector KPIs. Evidence is partially cited (press releases, transcripts), yet timeline inconsistencies (Q2 2025 data in an April 2025-dated report) and several uncited forecasts reduce consistency. Peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis are absent, limiting context and robustness. Redundancy appears (dividend streak and volatility normalization repeated across sections) without added depth. Overall, scope is broad but the KPI depth, peer context, and analytical rigor are insufficient for a higher grade.",
