    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report states several key drivers near the valuation (revenue CAGR 5%, margins to 25%, WACC 9%, terminal growth 3%, and an EPS bridge including provisions). Specificity: Many inputs have clear magnitudes and horizons (2025\u20132029), including segment-level growth (card fees 7%, NII 4%). Consistency: Forecast tables broadly reconcile to the stated assumptions (revenues imply ~5% CAGR; margin path 22%\u219225%; EPS 12\u219218). However, there are minor internal inconsistencies (e.g., claiming \u201cinsufficient data\u201d while presenting 2024 actuals; citing 10% upside despite \u201clast close insufficient data\u201d). Justification: Support is weak; several items are marked \u201c[assumed]\u201d with limited evidence from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources. Critical banking drivers (credit losses/charge-offs trajectory, tax rate, NIM/cost of funds) are not rigorously evidenced. Sensitivity: There is no quantified sensitivity/scenario work on material drivers (rates/NIM, credit cost, margins, WACC); only a qualitative mention of \u201c20% valuation swings,\u201d which is not driver-specific. Given the absence of robust sensitivity analysis and limited justification despite reasonable specificity and basic internal coherence, the assumptions quality merits a Fair grade.",
