    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely explicit and proximate to forecasts (revenue path, margins, WACC, terminal growth appear in \u2018Fair Value and Profit Drivers\u2019, the Financials Snapshot, and the Appendix). Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units (% and $ billions), and time horizons (2025\u20132029, 2026\u20132028) are stated. However, justification is weak: key inputs (WACC 10.5%, terminal growth 3%, margin expansion) lack cited evidence beyond general statements about volatility, cost cuts, and pipeline launches; peer/history benchmarks are minimal. Internal consistency has at least one clear numeric contradiction: the stated \u201c5-year revenue CAGR of -5% from 2025\u20132029\u201d conflicts with the revenue table that rises from $2.0B in 2025 to $6.5B in 2029. Sensitivity analysis is effectively absent for material drivers; while a broad \u201c\u00b130%\u201d FVE sensitivity and a qualitative 20% revenue risk are mentioned, there are no quantified driver-based scenarios (e.g., revenue/approval timing, margin, WACC) tied to valuation impact. Given one contradiction and lack of driver sensitivities, the assumptions quality is capped at Fair despite acceptable explicitness and specificity.",
