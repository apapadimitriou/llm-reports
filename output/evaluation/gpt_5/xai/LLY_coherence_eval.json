    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a generally coherent narrative with clear sections and reasonable cross-references: the Business Strategy & Outlook emphasizes incretin leadership and supply resolution, which supports the Fair Value assumptions (15% revenue CAGR, margin expansion), and Bulls/Bears largely echo Risks around competition and supply constraints. The Fair Value and Profit Drivers section aligns well with the Financials Snapshot and Appendix, notably the EPS bridge to $28 in 2029 and operating margin expansion to 35% by 2027. Language is mostly clear and transitions are adequate. However, a significant temporal inconsistency undermines coherence: the Cover Block lists a report date of 2025-06-07, while the Analyst Note discusses Q2 2025 earnings and cites sources dated 2025-08-07 and later, which would occur after the stated report date. This unaddressed timing mismatch triggers an auto-downgrade. There are minor rough edges: the claim that \u201cvaluation appears stretched at current levels\u201d lacks supporting price data (with Price/FVE listed as insufficient), which weakens the valuation narrative\u2019s grounding. Despite these issues, there are no material contradictions among assumptions, tables, and narrative; terminology is consistent, and the medium uncertainty rating is reflected across the risk discussion and valuation. Overall, understandable with some effort but internally noisy due to the timing mismatch.",
