    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: Core valuation drivers are stated clearly in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section and Appendix (revenue CAGR, WACC, terminal growth, operating margin path), with corresponding forecast tables. Specificity: Assumptions generally include magnitudes, units, and time horizons (e.g., 6% revenue CAGR 2025\u20132029; WACC 7.5% with beta 0.8; terminal growth 3%; op margin to 35% by 2029). Consistency: Most items reconcile to the forecast table, but there is a clear numeric contradiction between the narrative EPS target \u201c$25 by 2029\u201d and the table\u2019s \u201c$25.8\u201d for 2029. Sensitivity: There is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis on material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth), only qualitative risk discussion\u2014this alone caps the grade at Fair. Justification: Rationale is weak; revenue CAGR is tied mainly to one-quarter growth and \u201craised guidance,\u201d terminal growth is attributed to \u201clong-term industry average,\u201d and WACC lacks capital structure/cost of debt detail. No multi-year historical context or peer benchmarks are provided for margin improvement or growth. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific but thinly justified, with one internal contradiction and no stress-testing.",
