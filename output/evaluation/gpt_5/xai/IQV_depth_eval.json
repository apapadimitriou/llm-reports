    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by linking results and valuation to identifiable drivers and providing explicit, quantified assumptions. It offers causal explanations such as margin trajectory \u201cdriven by scale efficiencies in TAS and R&D\u201d and highlights execution risk via \u201cEPS decline of 27%.\u201d Forecasting is tied to observable data with \u201c5% revenue CAGR from 2025 to 2029,\u201d an EPS bridge, and backlog metrics that support visibility. Assumptions are transparent and partly benchmarked: \u201cWACC is estimated at 8.0%,\u201d \u201cTerminal growth is 3%,\u201d and implied valuation multiples are stated as aligned with peers. Data use is relatively strong, including book-to-bill, backlog size, EBITDA margins, and an EPS bridge. The treatment of uncertainty is present but not deeply modeled; while it cites a \u201c+/-20% swing in valuation,\u201d it does not decompose sensitivities by key inputs (e.g., backlog conversion rates, margin expansion pacing, or WACC). Actionable guidance appears with \u201cmonitor Q3 bookings for sustained momentum,\u201d though thresholds and scenario triggers are absent. Overall, mechanisms and quantified assumptions are clear and connected to the valuation, but limited sensitivity/scenario analysis and only light benchmarking on critical inputs prevent an Excellent rating.",
