    "summary_reasoning": "The report shows some analytical depth through causal explanations and explicit, quantified assumptions, but lacks benchmarking and rigorous sensitivity analysis. It explains Q2 results as \u201cdriven by higher fees and trading activity\u201d and EPS upside \u201csupported by cost controls and revenue momentum,\u201d linking outcomes to identifiable drivers. Forward-looking inferences are tied to segment drivers (services/markets) and a DCF with explicit inputs: \u201cRevenue is forecasted to grow at a 5% CAGR,\u201d \u201cWACC is estimated at 9%,\u201d and \u201cTerminal growth rate is 3%.\u201d It also acknowledges macro counterpoints with quantified ranges, noting rate cuts \u201creducing net interest margins by 5-10%\u201d and stating \u201cThese could swing valuation by 15-20%.\u201d However, the assumptions are not benchmarked against peers or historical company ranges (e.g., margin trajectory, ROTCE, credit costs), and the risk quantification is not traced through to EPS or fair value mechanics (no mapping from NIM or expenses to valuation). There are no scenario cases (base/bull/bear) or parameter sensitivities (WACC, terminal growth, margin expansion) to stress-test the DCF. Actionable implications are limited to relative valuation observations and a monitoring point. Overall, the report moves beyond description but falls short of benchmarked assumptions and structured, quantified scenario analysis.",
