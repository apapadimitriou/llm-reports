    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic restatements of public information (Q2 results, dividend increase, SCB, standard moat language) and a boilerplate DCF with no novel drivers. There is one weak synthesis\u2014inferring net interest margin stabilization from Zacks\u2019 EPS raise\u2014and a light causal claim that net income improved due to deposit growth, but neither is quantified, company-distinct, or tied to catalysts/timelines. No original theses are presented, and there is little peer-specific contrast beyond a passing mention of U.S. Bancorp. The valuation section lists conventional assumptions (CAGR, WACC, terminal growth, peer P/E alignment) without unique mechanisms (e.g., deposit betas, asset mix shifts, hedge impacts). Decision relevance is limited: only the fair value figure is company-specific, while most insights are sector-generic (rate path/NIM compression, CRE exposure, regulatory capital) and lack actionable angles. Given \u22653 generic restatements and the absence of novel valuation drivers, originality is capped at Fair per the hard caps.",
