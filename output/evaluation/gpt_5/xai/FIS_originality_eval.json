    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains multiple restatements of publicly available information (Q2 revenue/EPS, AI focus, switching costs, competition) with minimal interpretive layering. There are no clear syntheses that combine distinct data points into new conclusions (e.g., segment mix, contracts, or cost programs linked to margin trajectory), nor any original, testable thesis with mechanisms, numbers, and catalysts. The valuation section is a standard DCF (5% CAGR, 20% margin, 8.5% WACC, 3% terminal) without novel drivers tied to company-specific events (e.g., post-Worldpay portfolio changes, pricing strategies, or AI productivity uplift quantified). Peer angles are superficial (mentions Fiserv without comparative metrics). Decision relevance is limited to the fair value figure, which is not supported by unique insights. Boilerplate phrasing (\u201cscale,\u201d \u201chigh switching costs,\u201d \u201cdigital transformation\u201d) further indicates low originality. Per decision rules, the absence of synthesis/original theses and generic valuation cap the grade at Poor.",
