    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation and forecast inputs are generally explicit and proximate to the model: revenue CAGR, NII/noninterest growth split, margin trajectory, WACC, terminal growth, and an EPS bridge. Specificity is solid, with magnitudes, time windows (2025\u20132029), and units clearly stated. However, justification is partial: several drivers are anchored to broad claims (e.g., Q2 trends, efficiency gains) without multi-year historical evidence, peer benchmarks, or cited market-derived parameters (e.g., ERP, beta) beyond brief mentions. Internal consistency shows at least one contradiction\u2014the fair value implies \u201capproximately 12x\u201d forward P/E in the Analyst Note versus \u201c12.9x\u201d in the valuation section\u2014unresolved in the text. Sensitivity analysis is essentially absent; the report offers a generic \u00b120% valuation swing under stress but no quantified ranges tied to material drivers (NII/NIM, credit costs, margins, terminal growth, or WACC). As a result, stress-testing is inadequate and triggers the hard cap at Fair. Important drivers like tax rate, share count, and detailed credit cost assumptions are missing, diminishing traceability and robustness of conclusions.",
