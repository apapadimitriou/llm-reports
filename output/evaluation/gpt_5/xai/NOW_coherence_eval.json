    "reasoning": "The report is well structured with a clear arc (Q2 results \u2192 business model \u2192 outlook \u2192 moat \u2192 valuation \u2192 risks) and generally readable language. Sections often reference one another (e.g., AI and renewal rates appear in Analyst Note, Strategy/Outlook, and Moat), and the valuation discussion ties back to growth and margin expansion. However, key internal inconsistencies undermine coherence. First, growth assumptions conflict: the Appendix and Fair Value sections state a five-year revenue CAGR of 20% through 2029, while the Financials Snapshot implies ~18% CAGR with year-by-year deceleration to 15.5% in 2029, without explicitly resolving the discrepancy. Second, margins are mixed without clarity. The Analyst Note cites a 30.5% non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 2025, yet the 2025E op-margin in the table is 20% and the Fair Value narrative uses 2023 GAAP margins; the report never reconciles GAAP vs non-GAAP basis, creating confusion. There are also citation alignment issues, notably using a Nasdaq earnings dates page to support competitive threats, and speculative sourcing for RPO. While transitions are mostly smooth, these contradictions and mismatched citations force the reader to resolve the argument themselves, triggering a hard cap at fair per the rubric. Absent these issues, the cross-referencing and flow would merit a higher grade.",
