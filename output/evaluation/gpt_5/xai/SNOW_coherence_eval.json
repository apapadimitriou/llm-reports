    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report has an identifiable structure, but coherence is undermined by temporal inconsistencies, thin transitions, and weak cross-referencing. Most sections repeatedly state \u201cinsufficient data,\u201d which makes the narrative choppy and prevents a connected argument. A key temporal inaccuracy is citing sources dated August 2025 and discussing \u201cupcoming\u201d August 2025 earnings within a report dated February 27, 2025, without acknowledging the timing gap; this caps the grade at fair and signals internal chronology mismatches. The Bulls/Bears section is not reconciled with the base-case valuation: concerns about moderating growth and declining net retention are not integrated into the 30% revenue CAGR and 20% margin assumptions, resulting in an additional downgrade. Tables and narrative are poorly aligned: the Financials Snapshot presents all metrics as \u201cinsufficient,\u201d despite the narrative using fiscal 2025 product revenue guidance to underpin valuation assumptions, leaving unresolved tension between sections. While the Appendix assumptions echo the Fair Value section, there are limited transitions explaining how risks, moat, or strategy justify those inputs. Overall, readers must assemble the argument themselves, and the report does not proactively resolve key tensions (moderating growth vs. assumed acceleration, valuation vs. data gaps), leading to a low coherence score.",
