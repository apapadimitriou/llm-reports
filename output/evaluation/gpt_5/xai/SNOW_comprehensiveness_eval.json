    "summary_reasoning": "Headline sections are largely present (Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation, Risk, Capital Allocation, Financials, ESG, Appendix, Sources), but depth is thin across several, with repeated \"insufficient data\" placeholders. The Financials Snapshot is skeletal, lacking multi-year figures and sector-appropriate SaaS KPIs (ARR, RPO, consumption metrics, gross margin, FCF margin), which triggers the KPI hard cap. Valuation provides high-level assumptions (CAGR, margin, WACC, terminal growth) but does not bridge operating drivers to a fair value (no DCF, EPS/cash flow build, or explicit link from guidance/NRR to revenues/margins), invoking the valuation linkage hard cap. Evidence is inconsistently sourced, relying on social media posts, one source without a URL, and several uncited general claims (geography, competition). Peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis are absent. Capital allocation is not analyzed (no balance sheet, SBC, liquidity, or buybacks/dividends). There is some redundancy (mixed sentiment repeated; pervasive \"insufficient data\" across sections). Overall, the report covers the expected headings but lacks proportional depth, sector KPIs in the snapshot, explicit valuation linkage, and peer/sensitivity context, making it Fair for comprehensiveness.",
