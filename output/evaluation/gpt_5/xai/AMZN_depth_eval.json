    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal links and explicit, quantified assumptions, though it lacks formal sensitivity/scenario analysis. Strong causal explanations include \u201creflecting improved efficiency,\u201d \u201cmargin pressure from investments in AI and logistics,\u201d and AWS growth moderation as \u201ccustomers optimize spending.\u201d The inference quality is anchored by a DCF with stated drivers: \u201cassumes a 10% revenue CAGR over five years,\u201d \u201cOperating margins expand\u2026 to 12% by 2029,\u201d \u201cWACC of 8.0%,\u201d and \u201cTerminal growth is 4%.\u201d Quantification is used extensively (Q1 metrics, guidance ranges, segment growth rates, EPS bridge), and some benchmarking appears (\u201caligned with historical averages\u201d for multiples; revenue CAGR linked \u201cbased on Q1 growth and guidance\u201d). However, several assumptions are only generically justified (terminal growth, WACC inputs) and not stress-tested. Counterpoints and uncertainty are noted\u2014\u201cwe see downside if AWS growth decelerates\u201d and \u201cvaluation swings of \u00b120% possible\u201d\u2014but the report stops short of quantifying impacts on EPS or fair value across scenarios. Actionable guidance exists (\u201cInvestors should monitor AI capital expenditures\u201d), yet decision-relevant implications would be stronger with sensitivities (e.g., AWS growth \u00b15 pts, margin \u00b1100 bps) mapped to valuation. Overall, mechanisms and quantified assumptions are present, but the absence of explicit, quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis caps the depth.",
