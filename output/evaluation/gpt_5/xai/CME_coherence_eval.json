    "reasoning": "The report presents a recognizable structure with clear sections and a base-case narrative (record Q1 volumes \u2192 sustained margins \u2192 9% revenue CAGR \u2192 $240 FVE). Language is mostly clear, and there are some cross-links (e.g., Q1 results informing revenue/margin assumptions, Strategy acknowledging volatility normalization risk). However, coherence is marred by temporal inaccuracies and internal inconsistencies. The Analyst Note and valuation rely on Q2 2025 EPS and August 2025 articles while the report date is April 23, 2025, creating a time mismatch that undermines the flow and credibility. Assumption alignment is also uneven: the Fair Value section cites EPS reaching $16.50 by 2029, while the Financials Snapshot shows $16.1; the cover block labels the uncertainty rating as \u201cinsufficient data\u201d but the Risk section calls it \u201cmedium,\u201d an unresolved contradiction. Bulls/Bears highlight volume headwinds and technical neutrality, yet the base-case maintains aggressive 9% revenue growth without reconciliation or sensitivity analysis. Several sections read like lists with minimal connective tissue (Bulls/Bears; Risk & Uncertainty), further weakening transitions. Despite some consistent elements (60% margin across narrative and table; revenue forecasts tied to Q1 annualization), the report requires reader effort to reconcile inconsistencies.",
