    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure with a logical arc from recent results (Analyst Note) to strategy, moat, valuation, risks, and capital allocation. It uses consistent terminology (e.g., wide moat, medium uncertainty) and ties sections together reasonably well: the improved FY2025 outlook in the Analyst Note carries through to the Strategy/Outlook and informs the Fair Value\u2019s 5% CAGR. Forecasts in the Financials Snapshot align with the stated base case (2024 revenue $5.0B, 2025E $5.2B; EPS rising to $6.0 in 2025). However, there are notable coherence issues that constrain the grade. First, temporal inconsistencies: multiple citations are dated after the report date (e.g., [3] approx. 2025-07-27; [5] 2025-08-06), yet are used to substantiate present claims in a May 21, 2025 report. This undermines temporal alignment. Second, a valuation inconsistency: the Fair Value section states the $175 FVE \u201cimplies a forward P/E of 25x on 2026 EPS,\u201d while the table shows 2026 EPS of $6.5, which implies roughly 27x at the FVE\u2014an unaddressed discrepancy. There is also a citation alignment issue in ESG, where a Sustainalytics score is attributed to a TIME recognition source [5], which likely does not contain that metric. While the narrative flow is otherwise solid and Bulls/Bears are reconciled with the base-case, these temporal and internal inconsistencies merit a fair grade and an auto-downgrade.",
