However, the report does not provide sensitivities or scenario ranges; while it notes uncertainty as \u201cpotentially swinging valuation by 20-30%,\u201d it does not link this to specific variables (e.g., margin, price erosion, or WACC changes). Growth and margin assumptions are not decomposed by product/region nor stress-tested against competitive or regulatory outcomes, and the EPS bridge relies on an undeveloped \u201cassumed quarterly progression.\u201d Actionable implications are present via a fair value and \u201cmodest upside,\u201d but the absence of quantified sensitivities limits decision-relevance under uncertainty.",
