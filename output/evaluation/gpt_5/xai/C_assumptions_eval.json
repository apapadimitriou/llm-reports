    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are explicitly stated near the forecasts (revenue CAGR, margin path, WACC, terminal growth), supported by an assumptions table, and the financial forecast table reconciles with the stated 5% CAGR and the margin expansion path. Specificity is solid: units, magnitudes, and time horizons are clear (2025\u20132029 CAGR; margin from 25% to 30%; WACC components; terminal growth 3%). However, justification is partial: revenue growth is tied to a single quarter\u2019s trend; margin expansion is attributed broadly to \u201ctransformation efficiencies\u201d without quantified evidence; WACC lacks capital structure detail; terminal growth uses a GDP proxy without sources; EPS bridge omits tax rate and credit cost assumptions. Internal consistency has a notable contradiction: ROTCE \u201c11\u201312%\u201d medium-term vs \u201cmid-teens by 2026.\u201d Sensitivity analysis is limited\u2014NIM down 5\u201310% and valuation swing 15\u201320% are cited, but there are no robust scenarios or quantified sensitivities for other material levers (WACC, margins, credit costs, revenue). Missing assumptions include tax rate, credit losses, capex, and share count trajectories. Given the contradiction and limited sensitivity, the overall quality of assumptions is Fair.",
