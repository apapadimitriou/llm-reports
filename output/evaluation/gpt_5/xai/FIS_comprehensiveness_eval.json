    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all headline sections (Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation, Risk, Capital Allocation, Financials, ESG, Appendix, Sources) and includes multi-year historicals and forecasts with a DCF-based fair value. Valuation assumptions are explicit and reasonably linked to operating drivers (5% revenue CAGR, margin expansion, WACC, terminal growth, EPS bridge). Evidence is generally cited via in-text references, though some material claims (dividend payout target, buyback stance) lack sourcing. Key gaps reduce comprehensiveness: the Financials Snapshot omits sector-specific KPIs for fintech/software (ARR/NRR, bookings/backlog, retention/churn, payment volumes/take rate, organic vs inorganic growth), triggering the KPI hard cap. Peer benchmarking is absent beyond brief mentions, and no scenario or sensitivity analysis is provided. Capital allocation lacks balance-sheet detail (leverage ratios, maturities, liquidity). Minor contradictions appear (margin target timing 2027 vs 2029; uncertainty band definition vs stated swing). Some redundancy exists (repeated switching-costs and 5% growth themes without added depth). Overall, breadth is solid, but missing sector KPIs and analytical depth constrain the grade to Fair.",
