    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely unstated or explicitly deferred (\u201cInsufficient data\u2026 including revenue CAGR, margins, WACC\u2026\u201d), so the core drivers of forecasts and valuation are missing. Explicitness is weak: apart from a cited $2 billion, four-year investment plan and a historical revenue figure (> $40 billion), no revenue growth, margin, tax, WACC/COE, terminal growth, or share count assumptions are stated near any forecasts. Justification is minimal; sources corroborate the investment headline and revenue scale, but there is no evidence-based linkage to specific financial drivers or model inputs. Specificity is poor: magnitudes, units, and horizons for material drivers are absent, and the financial tables contain \u201cinsufficient data.\u201d Consistency is mostly moot due to the lack of inputs; minor ambiguity exists between a \u201cMedium\u201d uncertainty fair value range (25\u201350%) and a separate 10\u201320% valuation swing, but not a clear contradiction. Sensitivity/scenario analysis on material drivers is absent; the lone 10\u201320% swing is a qualitative macro comment rather than a quantified driver sensitivity tied to the model. Overall, the report\u2019s assumptions do not meet the criteria for an auditable, justified, and stress-tested framework.",
