    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: Core valuation drivers are clearly stated and centralized in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section and the Appendix (5% revenue CAGR, margin path to 25%, WACC 8%, terminal growth 3%), with a supporting forecast table. Specificity: Magnitudes, units, and horizons are generally specified (2025\u20132029 CAGR; 2029 operating margin; WACC and beta; 3% terminal growth). Justification: Evidence is limited/partial\u20145% CAGR is tied to a single quarter\u2019s 5.3% growth and \u201chistorical trends,\u201d WACC lacks a full build-up (no risk-free, capital structure, after-tax debt cost), terminal growth is attributed to a generic \u201cindustry average,\u201d and the margin path references EBITDA to infer operating margin. Consistency: There is a numeric contradiction between the EPS bridge (\u201c2025 EPS of $11.73\u201d from adjusted EPS) and the Financials Snapshot (\u201c2025 Forecast\u201d EPS 7.87), which affects implied valuation multiples. Sensitivity: No quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis on material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth) is provided; a lone +/-20% valuation swing is qualitative/opaque. Given the lack of sensitivities and the EPS contradiction, the assumptions merit a Fair grade despite acceptable explicitness and specificity in stated inputs.",
