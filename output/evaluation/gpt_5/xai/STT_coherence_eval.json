    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report has a recognizable structure and generally clear language, with a logical arc from Analyst Note through Strategy/Outlook, Moat, Valuation, Risks, and Appendix. Transitions are acceptable in most narrative sections, and risks and strategic themes (fee pressure, AuCA growth, interest rate sensitivity) are echoed across sections, lending some cross-sectional coherence. Temporal claims are aligned: Q1 2025 results in April and Q2 expected mid-July match the cited dates, avoiding time inaccuracies. However, internal consistency issues undermine overall coherence. The valuation narrative and appendix contain an unresolved contradiction: the EPS bridge references margin compression reducing earnings, while the assumptions table indicates margin expansion. Additionally, the EPS bridge calculates a 2025 EPS despite stating the 2024 EPS is \u201cinsufficient data,\u201d creating a logical gap. The fair-value commentary claims a modest premium to recent trading levels, yet the cover block provides no price data, leaving the assertion unsupported within the report. Tables are sparse or filled with \u201cinsufficient data,\u201d which weakens the connective tissue between narrative claims and figures. Despite these flaws, the report\u2019s thematic alignment (e.g., fee pressures, AuCA growth, and regulatory risk) and consistent terminology prevent a \u201cpoor\u201d grade. Given the contradictions among assumptions and narrative, the hard cap applies, resulting in a \u201cfair\u201d grade.",
