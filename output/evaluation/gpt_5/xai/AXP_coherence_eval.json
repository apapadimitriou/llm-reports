    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a generally structured narrative (introductory Analyst Note \u2192 strategy \u2192 moat \u2192 valuation \u2192 risks \u2192 capital allocation), and several elements align well (e.g., the 8% revenue CAGR in Fair Value, Appendix, and the Financials Snapshot). However, coherence is undermined by multiple internal contradictions and time-inaccurate sourcing. The Analyst Note claims the fair value \u201cimplies a 20x multiple on 2026 EPS,\u201d while the Fair Value section states \u201cImplied multiples: 20x 2025 EPS,\u201d without reconciling which year underpins the valuation. Similarly, Fair Value notes margins rising to 22% by 2029 from \u201c21% in 2025,\u201d yet the table shows 21.5% for 2025E. The Economic Moat section says AmEx\u2019s ~20% operating margins are \u201csuperior to peers like Visa (65%),\u201d which is logically inconsistent. Temporal alignment is also off: Q1 2025 results are attributed to a 2024-10-17 source, and 2025/2029 trends lean on a 2022 source, weakening recency claims. Finally, Bulls/Bears are not reconciled with the base-case valuation; Bears cite 18x forward EPS as elevated while the valuation narrative leans on 20x multiples, with no bridge explaining relative peer comparison or cycle risk. These issues force the reader to resolve conflicts themselves, triggering auto-downgrades under the rubric despite decent overall structure and some consistent assumptions.",
