    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections: cover block, contents, analyst note, business description, strategy, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risk, capital allocation, financials, ESG, appendix, and sources. Depth is generally reasonable, with operating drivers (billed business, card fees, credit metrics) linked to revenue/margin assumptions and a DCF framework. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits multiple sector-critical KPIs for a credit services issuer/network (e.g., multi-year billed business/payment volumes, loans outstanding, net interest income/NIM, provisions/net charge-offs, cards-in-force), triggering a cap at Fair. Evidence integration is mixed: most claims are cited, but some material points rely on outdated or mismatched sources (e.g., DOJ cases and cybersecurity cost references) and there is a notable contradiction comparing Amex\u2019s ~20% operating margin as \u201csuperior\u201d to Visa\u2019s ~65%. Peer benchmarking is minimal (brief margin and ESG score mentions) without a dedicated comparative analysis. There is some repetition of talking points (billed business growth and international momentum) across sections without added depth. Absence of formal scenario/sensitivity analysis further limits comprehensiveness despite otherwise broad coverage.",
