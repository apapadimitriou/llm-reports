    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely explicit and proximal to the forecasts: the report states a 3% revenue CAGR (2025\u20132029) with component drivers (2% loan, 4% fee growth), an operating margin band (28\u201330%), WACC (9.5% with beta 1.1 and ERP 5%), and terminal growth (2.5%). These inputs are specific with units and horizons, and they reconcile cleanly with the Financials Snapshot (e.g., margins rising from 26% in 2024 to 30% by 2029; EPS bridge to 2025E of $13.8). However, justification is only partial: the growth mix is attributed to [4] (an EPS estimate article) rather than to multi-year historical trends or peer benchmarks; WACC components (beta/ERP) and terminal growth lack sourced evidence; and the margin trajectory is not benchmarked to peers or historical efficiency ratios. Most importantly, there is no robust sensitivity/scenario analysis quantifying valuation impacts across material drivers. The lone quantified risk note on NIM compression (10\u201315 bps if rates fall) and a broad \u201cvaluation swings of 10\u201320%\u201d are not tied to the DCF outputs or to specific driver ranges. Under the hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivities for key levers (revenue/NIM, margins, credit costs, WACC) limits the overall assessment to Fair.",
