    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all headline sections with reasonable depth: Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix, and Sources. Valuation assumptions are explicit and link to operating drivers (segment growth rates, margin expansion, WACC inputs), which is a strength. Evidence is generally cited, though some material assertions in the moat section lack direct sourcing. The Financials Snapshot provides revenue, EPS, FCF, ROIC, and operating margin, but omits core sector KPIs for test & measurement (orders, book-to-bill, backlog, segment revenue mix, software/recurring revenue mix, gross margin), limiting comprehensiveness of the financial/KPI coverage. Peer context is mentioned briefly but lacks a dedicated benchmarking table. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is absent, and there is minor repetition of AI/6G tailwinds across multiple sections without added depth. Given the KPI omissions in the Financials Snapshot (\u22652 missing), the report is capped at Fair despite solid valuation linkage and broad sectional coverage.",
