    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are explicitly stated (revenue CAGR, margin range, WACC, terminal growth) and located near the valuation discussion or in the appendix. Specificity is partial: horizons and magnitudes are given for revenue CAGR (2025\u20132029), margins (25\u201328%), WACC (9% with beta and risk-free), and terminal growth (2.5%), but other material inputs (tax rate, share count, NII/NIM band, capex) are absent or qualitative only. Justification is weak: most assumptions reference \u201cindustry trends\u201d without multi-year company history, peer benchmarks, or cited quantitative sources; WACC lacks capital structure detail and ERP is mentioned without derivation. Internal consistency has a clear issue around margins: the appendix calls for \u201cMargin Expansion 1.0%\u201d while the narrative/bridge cites margin compression and the note cautions on margin pressure. Sensitivity analysis is absent\u2014no quantified scenarios or ranges for major levers (rates/NIM, fee growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth), triggering the hard cap at Fair. Overall, the assumptions are somewhat explicit and specific but lack supporting evidence and scenario analysis, with a notable contradiction on margins.",
