    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s originality is limited: most statements restate publicly available news (EPS/revenue beats, dealmaking rebound) and Morningstar-style narratives (wealth management scale, wide moat via switching costs). The valuation relies on generic DCF inputs (5% CAGR, margin expansion to 28%, WACC 9%) without introducing novel, company-specific drivers or mechanisms (e.g., compensation ratio dynamics, deposit/asset mix effects, capital relief timing). Decision relevance is modest; the only specific update is a raised 2025 EPS forecast, but it lacks an underlying differentiated analysis. There is one weak synthesis linking sector consolidation to M&A and to 4\u20136% revenue growth, yet it remains broad and unanchored to Morgan Stanley\u2019s unique positioning or catalysts. No original, testable theses with clear timelines or monitoring signals are presented, and peer contrasts are minimal. Given \u22653 insights are copied/restated and the absence of any novel valuation driver, the grade is capped at Fair under the hard rules.",
