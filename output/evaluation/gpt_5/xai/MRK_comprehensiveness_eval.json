    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "While the report includes a cover block, contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy/Outlook, Bulls/Bears, and a brief Risks section, most core sections are missing or explicitly labeled as \u2018insufficient data\u2019 (Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG, Appendix tables). The Financials Snapshot is skeletal, offering only partial Q1 revenue and EPS with no multi-year history, forecasts, or biopharma-specific KPIs. Valuation is absent and provides no linkage from operating drivers to fair value, triggering a hard cap. Evidence integration is inconsistent: an in-text citation [8] is missing from Sources, several material claims (e.g., Keytruda patent timeline, analyst forecasts) lack citations, and sources include items post-dating the report and an outdated 2022 link. Peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis are absent. There is redundancy, with Gardasil headwinds repeated in Analyst Note, Bears, and Risks without added depth. Overall, the report is incomplete and lacks the necessary data, KPIs, valuation bridge, capital allocation analysis, and ESG coverage to be considered comprehensive.",
