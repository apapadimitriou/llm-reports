    "summary_reasoning": "Core valuation drivers are explicitly stated near the forecasts: revenue CAGR (2025\u201329), segment growth rates, operating margin trajectory, WACC with components, terminal growth, and an exit multiple, with figures reconciled to the forecast table in most cases. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and time horizons are provided (e.g., $5.2B 2025 revenue base; margins rising to 27% by 2029; WACC breakdown). Justification is partial: the report cites general segment trends and peer alignment but provides limited evidence (history/peer comparisons or sourced market data) to support WACC inputs, terminal growth, and exit multiple. Internal consistency has a numeric contradiction between the text (24% 2025 margin) and the table (24.5%), though other items broadly align. Sensitivity analysis is absent; risks are discussed qualitatively without quantified ranges or scenario tables tied to material drivers, triggering a hard cap at Fair. Several important assumptions (tax rate, capex/working capital, share count/buyback cadence) are missing or opaque, reducing auditability of the model\u2019s drivers.",
