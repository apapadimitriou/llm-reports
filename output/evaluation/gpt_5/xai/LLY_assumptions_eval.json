    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are explicitly stated near the forecasts (revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, WACC, terminal growth) with clear magnitudes, units, and horizons, and the financials table reconciles with the narrative for revenue and operating margin paths. However, justification is weak-to-partial: several inputs reference guidance or generic rationales (e.g., \u201cindustry average\u201d terminal growth) without multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or detailed sourcing; WACC lacks capital structure and cost of debt support. Specificity is solid for core drivers (percentages and years provided), but important assumptions are missing or opaque (share count/dilution, tax rate, capex, cost of debt). Internal consistency has at least one numeric contradiction: the EPS bridge\u2019s additive components do not arithmetically sum to the 2029 EPS stated, triggering a cap at Fair. Sensitivity analysis on material drivers is absent; the report offers only a broad \u00b130% fair value band without tying outcomes to specific variables (e.g., revenue growth, margins, WACC), failing stress-testing standards. Overall, while the main inputs are explicit and specific, limited evidence, missing drivers, lack of scenarios, and an EPS inconsistency constrain the quality to Fair.",
