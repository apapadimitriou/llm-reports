    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely absent or qualitative. Explicitness is weak: the report repeatedly states \u201cInsufficient data\u201d across key drivers (revenue CAGR, margins, WACC, terminal growth) and does not present a valuation model. The few assumptions that do appear (e.g., \u201clow-to-mid single-digit revenue growth\u201d) are not tied to forecast tables or a coherent model, and are scattered rather than proximal to outputs. Justification is weak: the mid-single-digit growth statements are not supported with multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or sourced cost-of-capital data; the only cited figure is a single quarter\u2019s revenue (Q2 2025) and a 9.5% y/y growth datapoint. Specificity is weak: magnitudes lack precise ranges, units, and operational drivers; margins are discussed qualitatively with no percentages or timelines. Internal consistency is generally clean (no direct numeric contradictions), but the model remains a black box. Sensitivity analysis is effectively absent; a vague \u201ccould swing valuation by 10\u201320%\u201d is not tied to material drivers or valuation impacts. Overall, the assumptions do not meet the standards for explicit, justified, specific, or stress-tested inputs.",
