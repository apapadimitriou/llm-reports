    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are reasonably explicit and numerically specified: a 5% revenue CAGR (2025\u20132029), margin expansion to 28% by 2027, WACC of 9% (beta 1.2, risk-free 4.0%), and terminal growth of 3%. These appear near the forecast table and the DCF discussion, and the revenue/margin path reconciles with the Financials Snapshot. However, justification is weak: the revenue growth rationale relies largely on generic statements and a non-primary source; WACC and terminal growth lack sourced evidence or peer/market benchmarks, and there is no segment-level history or cost program detail to support margin expansion. Specificity is solid for the items stated, but critical drivers like tax rate, share count/buybacks within the model, credit costs/NII, and capex are missing or opaque. Consistency is impaired by a numeric contradiction on 2025 EPS (\u201c$7.50\u201d vs \u201c$7.30\u201d in narrative/table). Sensitivity analysis is absent; while risks mention potential recession reducing deal activity 20\u201330%, there is no quantified scenario linking drivers (revenue, margins, WACC) to valuation or earnings ranges. Under the decision rules, the lack of sensitivities and the EPS contradiction cap the report at Fair despite the presence of some explicit assumptions.",
