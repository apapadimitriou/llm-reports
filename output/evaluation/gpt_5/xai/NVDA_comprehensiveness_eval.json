    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most headline sections (cover block, analyst note, business description, strategy/outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, appendix, sources), but many are skeletal and labeled \u201cinsufficient data.\u201d The valuation section explicitly lacks a model and does not link operating drivers (e.g., segment growth, margins, capex) to the fair value\u2014triggering a hard cap at Fair. The Financials Snapshot is thin and mixes metrics (gross margin noted under operating margin) and omits core semiconductor KPIs (gross margin series, segment mix, capex, R&D%, inventory/ASPs), breaching the KPI hard cap. Evidence integration is inconsistent: several material figures (EPS, gross margin vs. estimates, data center revenue vs. estimates) rely on unspecified \u201cX posts,\u201d and a 20\u201330% valuation swing is asserted without sourcing. Peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis are absent, reducing industry context and robustness. There is minor redundancy (repeated 69% YoY data center growth and \u201cinsufficient data\u201d disclaimers across sections) without added depth. While the table of contents is complete and sources are listed, the lack of detailed financial history/forecast tables, sector KPIs, model assumptions (WACC, terminal growth), and peer context limits comprehensiveness.",
