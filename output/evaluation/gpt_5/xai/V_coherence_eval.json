    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure (Analyst Note \u2192 Strategy/Outlook \u2192 Moat \u2192 Valuation \u2192 Risks \u2192 Capital Allocation) and generally consistent terminology (operating margin, EPS, WACC, revenue CAGR). Sections cross-reference reasonably: Strategy\u2019s 8\u201310% revenue growth and robust margins are reflected in the Valuation/Assumptions and the Financials Snapshot, and the buyback in Bulls is reiterated in Capital Allocation. However, coherence is undermined by several internal inconsistencies. Most notably, the Fair Value and Appendix assume a 10% revenue CAGR for 2025\u20132029, while the Financials Snapshot forecasts imply closer to ~9% annual growth across those years (e.g., 38.2 to 41.8 to 45.6 to 49.9 to 54.4). The Analyst Note asserts a \u201cslight deceleration,\u201d citing payment volume growth \u201cslowed from 8% in fiscal Q2 2024,\u201d yet Q2 2025 payment volume is also stated as 8%, creating a contradiction. Citation alignment is also uneven: the Economic Moat section references a Q2 2025 margin (61%) but cites a FY24 source. Flow within sections is mostly readable, but occasional logical rough edges (e.g., listing risks then saying they \u201ccontribute to a low uncertainty rating\u201d) introduce noise. Overall, the narrative is understandable, but the contradictions between assumptions and the forecast table trigger a hard cap at fair.",
