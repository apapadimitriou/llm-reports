    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are explicitly stated and proximal to forecasts (revenue CAGR, margin path, WACC, terminal growth), with clear units and horizons. Specificity is solid: the DCF assumes \u201c6% revenue CAGR from 2025\u20132029,\u201d \u201cWACC 8.5%,\u201d and \u201cterminal growth 3%,\u201d and ties margin expansion to the services mix. However, justification is partial: references to sources exist but lack multi-year benchmarking or peer comparisons for WACC, terminal rate, and margin trajectory; tax rate and capex/working capital drivers are omitted. Internal consistency has a numeric conflict between the narrative margin target (32% by 2029) and tables (32.5%), which constrains the grade. Sensitivity analysis is absent on material drivers; there are no quantified ranges for revenue growth, margin, WACC, or terminal growth, nor a valuation impact table\u2014only a qualitative note that regulatory outcomes could swing value by 15\u201320%. Share repurchase magnitude is mentioned, but no explicit share count trajectory. Given explicitness and specificity but weak justification, a contradiction, and no quantified sensitivities, the assumptions quality is Fair.",
