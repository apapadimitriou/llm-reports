    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains no clear syntheses or original theses. Most statements restate earnings headlines or generic bank-sector themes (scale, switching costs, digital engagement) without adding company-specific mechanisms or causal links. The valuation section uses a standard DCF with vanilla inputs (WACC, terminal growth, margin expansion) and does not introduce novel drivers (e.g., deposit betas, asset duration, funding mix) to explain BAC\u2019s margin/NII trajectory. Forecasts like 2025 EPS $3.50 and revenue CAGR 3.5% are presented without distinct catalysts, timing, or peer contrasts, limiting decision relevance. While the fair value ($45) and EPS forecast are company-specific, they lack unique insight and are not supported by differentiated analysis. Multiple items paraphrase sources (Q2 beat/miss details, 4% revenue growth, digital adoption from the earnings call), and the bull/bear cases are boilerplate. Given zero synthesis/original theses and a generic valuation framework, the originality of insights is low, triggering the \u201cPoor\u201d grade per decision rules.",
