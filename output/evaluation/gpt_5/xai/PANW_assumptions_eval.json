    "summary_reasoning": "Core valuation inputs are made explicit and proximal to forecasts (revenue CAGR, operating margin path, WACC, terminal growth), with clear units and multi-year horizons. Specificity is solid for those items, and tables reconcile with the stated CAGR and margin targets. However, justification is partial: revenue CAGR is loosely tied to industry growth and RPO, while WACC (9.5%) and terminal growth (4%) lack detailed evidence (risk-free rate, ERP, capital structure) or peer benchmarks; the margin expansion is attributed to mix shift without quantifying the mix trajectory. Consistency is marred by a numeric contradiction in the EPS bridge (components do not sum to the stated FY2029 EPS), triggering a hard cap. Sensitivity/scenario analysis is absent for material drivers (no ranges for revenue, margins, WACC, terminal growth), which further enforces the Fair cap. Several material drivers are missing or opaque (tax rate, share count/dilution, capex/FCF drivers), making parts of the model feel black-box despite the summary table. Overall, assumptions are stated and partially justified but lack robustness and stress testing.",
