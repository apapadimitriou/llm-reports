    "summary_reasoning": "The report states several key inputs (revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, WACC, terminal growth) near the valuation section, so explicitness is decent. However, justification is weak: figures like 8.5% WACC, 3% terminal growth, 8% AUM growth, and 1% fee expansion lack support from history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources; multiple lines even note \u201cinsufficient data.\u201d Specificity is partial: time horizons and magnitudes are provided, but drivers (e.g., fee rate mechanics, capex/FCF build, tax rate, share count) are not specified. Internal consistency is compromised by contradictions between narrative and tables (margin expansion 1.5% vs improvement from 36% to 38% by 2029; EPS $42 vs $41.5). Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for material drivers (AUM growth, fee rates, margins, WACC, terminal growth), only a broad \u201c20% valuation swing,\u201d which is output-focused and qualitative. Under the decision rules, one contradiction plus no sensitivities yields a Poor grade despite some explicit inputs.",
