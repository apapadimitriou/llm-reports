    "summary_reasoning": "Most material drivers are stated explicitly and proximal to the forecasts: revenue CAGR (2025\u20132029), AI/software growth rates, margin trajectory, WACC and terminal growth are clearly specified with units and horizons. Specificity is solid for these items (percentages, years, and causal drivers such as AI and VMware synergies). However, justification is partial: figures are loosely tied to Q2 results and generic industry narratives, with limited evidence from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or sourced parameters (e.g., AI growth 30%, software 5% lack citations; WACC lacks cost of debt/capital structure detail). Internal consistency has at least one contradiction: the implied EV/EBITDA at the fair value is \u201c20x\u201d in the Analyst Note but \u201c18x\u201d in Fair Value and Profit Drivers, and this is not reconciled. Sensitivity analysis is absent; risks are discussed qualitatively, but there are no quantified ranges or scenarios for key drivers (revenue growth, margins, AI mix, WACC/terminal growth), triggering the hard cap at Fair. Several material inputs are missing or opaque (tax rate, capex/working capital, share count/buybacks/dilution mechanics), reducing auditability of the DCF/FCF bridge. Overall, the assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified, with a contradiction and no quantitative sensitivities.",
