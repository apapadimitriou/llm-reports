    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are mostly explicit and numerically specific (e.g., 8% revenue CAGR 2025\u20132029, operating margins 3.5\u20134%, MLR 88\u201389%, WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 3%, EPS bridge with share dilution). Assumptions are placed near the forecasts they inform (Fair Value and Financials Snapshot), supporting explicitness and specificity. However, justification is weak: major parameters (MLR, WACC, terminal growth) are largely \u201cmodel-derived\u201d with limited citation or benchmarking; demographic and CenterWell references are qualitative. Internal consistency has two clear contradictions: medium-term revenue growth is stated as 4\u20136% while the model/table apply ~8%; and the claim that ROIC exceeds WACC by 4\u20135 points conflicts with the provided ROIC figures and an 8.5% WACC. Stress-testing is absent\u2014no quantified sensitivities or scenarios on material levers (MLR, rates, membership, WACC), only qualitative risk mentions. Under decision rules, the combination of \u22652 contradictions and lack of sensitivity analysis requires a Poor grade despite decent specificity.",
