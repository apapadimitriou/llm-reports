    "reasoning": "The report has a clear top-down structure (Analyst Note \u2192 Strategy/Outlook \u2192 Bulls/Bears \u2192 Moat \u2192 Valuation \u2192 Risks \u2192 Capital Allocation \u2192 Financials), and terminology is used consistently across sections (e.g., franchises like TAVR, PFA, diabetes). Transitions within sections are generally serviceable, with Strategy/Outlook explicitly linking back to performance described in the Analyst Note. However, coherence is undermined by two material inconsistencies and sparse cross-referencing. First, the Analyst Note asserts that quantitative details for FY2025 Q2 and later are not available, yet it simultaneously cites Q2 and Q3 FY2025 company press releases, which typically contain such figures. This contradiction is echoed by the entirely N/A Financials Snapshot and Appendix, without reconciling why cited sources could not support at least directional metrics. Second, there is a temporal mismatch: the report date is 2025-07-07, but it claims \u201cas of the report date\u201d an announcement about an August 19, 2025 event, while the cited source is from early August, after the report date. Across sections, repeated \u201cinsufficient data\u201d statements limit integration; Bulls/Bears are not connected to any base-case valuation since none is provided, leaving the investment debate detached from a central thesis with quantified outcomes. Overall readability is adequate, but the internal contradictions and time inaccuracy cap coherence.",
