    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly restatements of publicly available Q2 metrics and boilerplate themes (network effects, fintech competition, cashless shift). I identified one original thesis (Latin America/Africa contributing 20% of incremental revenue) that is company-specific and quantified, but it lacks mechanism, catalysts, or evidence, reducing decision relevance strength. There is one synthesis that quantifies regulatory exposure (10\u201315% of revenue), which is decision-relevant, but it is not developed with segment-level drivers or timelines. The valuation section relies on standard DCF inputs (12% revenue CAGR, modest margin expansion, 8.5% WACC, 4% terminal growth) without introducing novel drivers (e.g., cross-border mix, value-added attach rates, pricing dynamics), triggering a cap at Fair. At least four insights are copied/paraphrased or generic, and peer-specific angles are minimal and not used to advance a thesis. Overall, originality is limited, with some company-level numbers but few unique mechanisms, catalysts, or comparative insights.",
