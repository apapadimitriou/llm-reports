    "reasoning": "The report has a clear structure and mostly smooth flow from recent results (Analyst Note) to strategy, moat, valuation, risks, and capital allocation. Key terms are used consistently (gross vs operating margin; WACC/COE), and several cross-references reinforce coherence, such as WACC (9.0%) and 2029 operating margin (42%) aligning between the Fair Value section and Appendix, and the EPS bridge mapping to the Financials Snapshot. However, material internal inconsistencies undermine overall coherence. The most significant is the growth baseline: the Analyst Note models FY2025 revenue at $9.2 billion, implying 22.7% growth from FY2024, while the Financials Snapshot lists 2024 actual revenue as $7.0 billion; that baseline would imply ~31% growth, not 22.7%. A second contradiction appears in the Fair Value assumptions: the narrative assumes a 20% revenue CAGR from 2025\u20132029, yet the forecast table (9.2 to 16.1) implies roughly 15% CAGR with mid-teens annual growth, not 20%. These misalignments between text and tables trigger a hard cap under the rubric. Additionally, reliance on placeholders like \u201cinsufficient data\u201d and an imprecise citation (\u201cposts found on X\u201d) for the 2024 actuals weakens the connective tissue and credibility of the data inputs. Bulls/Bears are broadly echoed in Risks, but without explicit reconciliation to the base-case valuation assumptions. Overall, understandable but internally noisy.",
