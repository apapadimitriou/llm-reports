    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is decent: the report states core drivers near the forecasts (12% revenue CAGR 2025\u20132029, margin trajectory to 33% by 2029, WACC 8.5% with components, 3% terminal growth, and a 2025 capex figure). Specificity is solid with clear units, magnitudes, and horizons for revenue growth, operating margins, WACC inputs, and EPS path. However, justification is weak: most parameters are asserted with minimal evidence beyond generic references to \u201chistorical growth\u201d or a single source; there is no multi-year peer benchmarking for margins, growth, or cost of capital, and no sourcing for risk-free rate, ERP, or beta. Internal consistency has a material issue: the Financials Snapshot shows \u201c2024A Revenue 3580.0,\u201d which conflicts with adjacent years and the stated 12% CAGR path. Sensitivity analysis is absent: there are no quantified scenarios or ranges for key drivers (revenue growth, margins, capex, WACC, terminal growth) or their impact on valuation; the qualitative 20\u201330% valuation swing is not tied to specific levers. Given the lack of sensitivities and the numeric contradiction, the appropriate grade is Fair under the stated hard caps.",
