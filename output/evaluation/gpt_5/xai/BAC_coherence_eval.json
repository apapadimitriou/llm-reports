    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report has a clear structure and a mostly coherent narrative: Analyst Note introduces Q2 themes, Strategy/Outlook extends them, and Fair Value ties assumptions to forecasts. Cross-references are present (e.g., digital engagement in Analyst Note and Strategy; CET1 ratio appearing in Moat and Capital Allocation), and the Financials Snapshot aligns with stated margin expansion from 28% to 32% by 2029. Revenue growth guidance of 3\u20135% is consistent with the table\u2019s implied CAGR. However, two issues materially disrupt coherence. First, there is a temporal inconsistency: the report date is July 2, 2025, yet it discusses and cites Q2 2025 results and an earnings call sourced on July 16 and July 20, which would not have been available at publication, undermining the flow and credibility of the \u201cupdates to our outlook.\u201d Second, there is an internal valuation inconsistency: the fair value implies \u201capproximately 12x\u201d forward P/E in the Analyst Note, while the valuation section states 12.9x at fair value. Citation alignment is also noisy; the CET1 ratio is attributed to a Nasdaq page on earnings dates, which likely doesn\u2019t support that metric, and ESG sourcing is acknowledged as insufficient. Language is mostly clear and transitions are adequate, but these contradictions and temporal issues cap the grade at fair under the guardrails.",
