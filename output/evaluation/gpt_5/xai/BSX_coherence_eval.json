    "reasoning": "The report is generally well structured, with clear sectioning from Analyst Note through Valuation, Risks, and Capital Allocation. Language is readable and most sections reference the growth and margin expansion thesis, creating some connective tissue between outlook, valuation assumptions, and uncertainty. However, multiple internal inconsistencies undermine coherence. The Analyst Note asserts the company can sustain \u201cmid-teens revenue growth through 2029,\u201d while the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section and Financials Snapshot are built around a 10% revenue CAGR and explicit revenue forecasts that align with roughly 10%. This tension is not reconciled. Quantitatively, the report cites Q2 2025 revenue of $5.06 billion yet presents a 2025 full-year revenue forecast of $17.0 billion \u201cbased on Q2 trends,\u201d which appears inconsistent with the quarterly run rate implied by Q2. Temporal coherence is also problematic: the report date is 2025-06-28, but it references Q2 2025 results and cites a source dated approximately 2025-08-03, creating a time-inaccuracy within the document. While Bulls/Bears are standard and the risk section echoes some bear points, the valuation narrative does not explicitly integrate competitive or regulatory downside into the base-case metrics. Minor terminology drift (e.g., \u201cendosurgery\u201d vs. previously defined segments) and missing citations in ESG further add noise. These issues cap the report at fair under the guardrails.",
