    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s insights are largely generic restatements of public information with one weak synthesis. Most analysis repeats headlines (Q2 beat, shift from MS to diversified pipeline, regulatory risks) and standard biotech boilerplate (wide moat via patents, diversification into biosimilars). The valuation relies on a conventional DCF with standard inputs (WACC, terminal growth, margin expansion) and lacks any novel driver or mechanism (e.g., Leqembi co-commercialization economics, infusion capacity constraints, payer coverage trajectories). The only synthesis links segment dynamics (\u22485% neurology growth offset by \u22122% MS decline \u2192 ~4% total CAGR), but it remains high-level and unaccompanied by catalysts, timelines, or quantified adoption curves. Several numeric elements (35% margin, $800M cost savings, EPS bridge) are model artifacts rather than unique, decision-relevant theses. There is minimal peer-specific contrast beyond a superficial ESG rating comparison. Decision relevance is limited: the margin expansion and segment-CAGR interplay affect earnings, but the lack of specific catalysts or monitoring signals reduces actionability. Boilerplate phrasing and a generic Bulls/Bears section reinforce a low originality profile, warranting a Fair grade under the cap for non-novel valuation.",
