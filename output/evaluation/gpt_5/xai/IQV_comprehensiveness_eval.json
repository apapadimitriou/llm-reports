    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most headline sections (Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials, ESG, Appendix, Sources) with reasonable sector context and multiple in-text citations. Valuation includes an explicit EPS bridge and DCF parameters, linking revenue growth and margin expansion to fair value. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits core CRO/data analytics KPIs that are expected in tables (multi-year bookings, backlog, book-to-bill history, segment mix, cancellation/pass-through metrics), triggering the KPI hard cap. Peer benchmarking is minimal (one competitor mention, no comparative tables or sourced multiples), and there is no scenario or sensitivity analysis. Some claims lack citations (peer multiple alignment, beta, capital returns/FCF), and there is an inconsistency between adjusted EPS used in valuation and GAAP-like EPS shown in the Financials table without clarifying basis. Minor redundancy appears (backlog/book-to-bill repeated across sections with limited added depth). These gaps reduce comprehensiveness despite otherwise solid structure and linkage in valuation.",
