    "summary_reasoning": "Key modeling assumptions are explicit and proximate to forecasts (revenue CAGR, margin path, WACC, terminal growth, EPS) and expressed with clear magnitudes, units, and time horizons. The Appendix table further consolidates these inputs. However, justification is limited: growth/margin assumptions are tied broadly to Q1 results and \u201cguidance\u201d without multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or sourced parameters for WACC/ERP/beta beyond brief rationale; terminal growth is asserted as GDP+inflation with no citation. Internal consistency is impaired by a numeric contradiction between the narrative ($55B FY2029 revenue) and the Financials Snapshot ($51.3B FY2029). Stress-testing is absent: no quantified sensitivities or scenarios for material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC/terminal growth), only a qualitative 20\u201330% valuation swing. Several important drivers (tax rate, share count/dilution, capex) are missing or opaque. Overall, while assumptions are mostly explicit and specific, the weak evidence base, a clear contradiction, and lack of scenario analysis cap the assessment at Fair.",
