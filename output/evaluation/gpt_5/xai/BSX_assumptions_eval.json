    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report states core drivers near the valuation, including a 10% revenue CAGR (2025\u20132029), margin expansion to 25% by 2029, segment CAGRs (cardiovascular 12%, endosurgery 8%), WACC of 8%, and a 3% terminal growth rate. Specificity: Assumptions include magnitudes, units, and horizons; the margin path (22% \u2192 25%) and the EPS bridge quantify impacts (e.g., -$0.10 from taxes). Consistency: Figures reconcile across narrative and tables (e.g., 2025\u20132029 revenue pathway and margin trajectory; EPS bridge matches the 2025 EPS forecast). Justification: Support is weak. The 10% multi-year revenue CAGR is justified by \u201cQ2 growth trends,\u201d not multi-year history or peer benchmarks. WACC inputs lack full capital structure detail; terminal growth is attributed to a sector average without citation; segment CAGRs are un-sourced. Sensitivity: There is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis on material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth). A general statement that risks could swing valuation 20\u201330% is not a driver-level sensitivity. Given explicit but lightly justified assumptions and absence of driver-based sensitivities, the appropriate grade is Fair under the stated hard caps.",
