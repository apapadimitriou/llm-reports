    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation inputs are explicitly stated in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section and Appendix with clear units and horizons (e.g., 2025\u20132029 revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, WACC, terminal growth). Specificity is solid for these core levers. However, justification is weak: most rationales are generic (\"based on guidance and trends,\" \"industry averages,\" \"GDP proxy\") without multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or sourced parameter build-ups. Internal consistency is compromised by a numeric contradiction on 2025 EPS ($10.86 in Analyst Note vs $10.80 in the EPS bridge and table). Sensitivity analysis is absent for material drivers (no ranges for revenue growth, margins, WACC, or terminal growth), and the lone quantified risk (margins down 1\u20132%) is not tied to valuation or scenarios. Important drivers remain opaque or missing (share count, capex/working capital, explicit tax rate, debt cost). Given the contradiction plus no sensitivities, the assumptions quality meets the threshold for Poor under the stated hard caps.",
