    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly generic restatements about custody banks (AuCA growth, fee compression, ESG/digital trends) and broad macro/regulatory risks. It lacks company-specific syntheses or original theses that connect multiple data points into new, decision-relevant conclusions. The valuation section is a standard DCF with boilerplate inputs (WACC, terminal growth) and no novel drivers or mechanisms linking STT\u2019s distinctive metrics (e.g., cash sorting, deposit beta, asset mix, servicing pipeline) to earnings or margins; the EPS bridge uses placeholders and vague attributions. Monitoring suggestions for Q2 (AuCA, fees, guidance) are generic and not tied to specific catalysts or timelines. Peer context is minimal and superficial (BNY Mellon mentioned without comparative analysis). Overall, there are zero clear syntheses or original theses, low specificity, and limited actionability. Hard caps apply: no synthesis and valuation lacks novel drivers, yielding a Poor originality grade.",
