    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all headline sections (cover, contents, analyst note, description, strategy, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, financials, ESG, appendix, sources). However, depth is uneven and sector-appropriate KPIs for a diversified biopharma/medtech company are largely absent from the Financials Snapshot, which relies on generic metrics and leaves multiple historical fields as \u201cinsufficient data.\u201d While the valuation section does link operating drivers (revenue CAGR, margin expansion) to EPS and a DCF-derived fair value, sourcing is inconsistent (e.g., social media and approximated dates), and several material assertions lack citations. Peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis are missing, limiting context and robustness. Redundancy is present, with repeated themes (aging demographics, dividend increases, talc risk) appearing across sections without added depth. Contradictions (2025 EPS 10.86 vs 10.80; inclusion of consumer health despite Kenvue spin-off; low uncertainty despite >$10B talc risk claim) further reduce cohesiveness. Given the hard cap for missing core sector KPIs and inconsistent sourcing, the comprehensiveness is capped at Fair despite broad section coverage and a basic valuation bridge.",
