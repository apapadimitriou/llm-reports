    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains predominantly restated or paraphrased content (earnings beats, dividend increase, generic macro headwinds, wide moat rationales) with minimal interpretive commentary. No clear syntheses link multiple data points into a novel conclusion (e.g., mechanics of Stelara LOE versus specific pipeline offsets, MedTech mix/pricing effects on margin trajectories, or quantified litigation scenarios). The valuation section is boilerplate: standard WACC/terminal growth, generic margin expansion, and a simplistic EPS bridge without company-distinct drivers or catalysts. There are no original theses with mechanisms, numbers, and timelines; nor are there peer comparisons or monitoring signals. Several insights mirror investor relations and secondary sources without advancing a unique angle. Decision relevance is low: assertions are broad (\u201cdiversified portfolio,\u201d \u201cinflation pressures\u201d) and lack specificity or actionability. Given zero synthesis/original thesis and multiple generic restatements, the originality of insights is poor, and the valuation hard cap to Fair would apply anyway, but the lack of synthesis triggers a Poor grade.",
