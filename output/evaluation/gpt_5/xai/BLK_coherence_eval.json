    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report has a clear structure and attempts to link sections (e.g., the Fair Value assumptions appear in the Appendix), but multiple internal contradictions and time/citation misalignments undermine coherence. Most notably, margin expansion is inconsistent across sections: the Appendix lists \u201cMargin Expansion: 1.5%,\u201d while the Fair Value narrative states margins improve from 36% (2024) to 38% (2029), and the Financials Snapshot shows 36.5% to 38.5%\u2014none of which reconcile with the 1.5% figure. EPS guidance is similarly inconsistent: the Analyst Note cites FY2025 EPS of $42, but the Fair Value section and the Financials table both present $41.5. Temporal/citation issues further impair flow: the Analyst Note characterizes [2] (dated 2025-08-07) as \u201crecent\u201d ahead of the 2025-07-07 report date, and uses [4] (2025-07-15) and [3] (2025-07-10) to support pre-earnings expectations, creating confusion about whether results are preliminary or reported. Finally, Bears\u2019 fee compression risk is not reconciled with the base-case assumption of 1% fee expansion in the valuation, leaving a core tension unaddressed. While the narrative arc (scale, technology, AUM growth driving valuation) is understandable, these contradictions and temporal mismatches force the reader to resolve conflicts and detract from a cohesive, connected argument.",
