Specificity is solid\u2014units, magnitudes, and horizons are provided, and the EPS bridge ties cleanly to the forecast table. However, justification is weak: WACC inputs lack cited market sources or capital structure weights; the 12% value-added services growth and 4% terminal rate are asserted without evidence beyond generic rationale; several items are marked \u201cinsufficient data.\u201d Internal consistency has minor issues, including a numeric mismatch between the 10% revenue CAGR assumption and the forecast table (~9.2% CAGR from 2025 to 2029), and a claim of deceleration while citing equal 8% payment volume growth for Q2 2024 and Q2 2025. Sensitivity analysis is limited: one quantified growth sensitivity (+/-2% growth \u2192 ~15% fair value swing) and a qualitative/regulatory range (5\u201310% revenue impact) without valuation linkage; there are no margin, WACC, or terminal growth sensitivities. Missing stress tests on multiple material drivers cap the assessment at Fair.",
