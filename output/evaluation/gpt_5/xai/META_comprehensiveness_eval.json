    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most headline sections (Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation, Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials, ESG, Appendix, Sources) with reasonable proportionality across qualitative areas. However, comprehensiveness is undermined by a thin and generic Financials Snapshot that omits core internet advertising KPIs (DAU/MAU, ARPU by region, ad impressions, average price per ad, FoA vs Reality Labs segment financials). Forecast tables include placeholders like \u201cInsufficient data,\u201d weakening completeness. Valuation provides a DCF with high-level assumptions (revenue CAGR, margins, WACC, terminal growth) but does not bridge from operating drivers (impressions, pricing, ARPU, segment mix) to the forecast, failing to link drivers explicitly to value. Evidence integration is inconsistent: multiple material claims are labeled \u201cinsufficient data for citation\u201d or rely on uncited/URL-less social media posts (e.g., digital ad growth rate, ESG score, capex guidance), and several assertions in Capital Allocation lack sourcing. Peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis are absent. There is some redundancy, with Q1 growth/margin figures repeated across Analyst Note, Bulls/Bears, and Moat with limited added depth. Given the KPI omissions in the Financials Snapshot, weak sourcing on several key claims, and valuation-driver disconnect, the report meets only a Fair level of comprehensiveness.",
