    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely explicit and proximate to the forecasts: the report states a 20% five-year revenue CAGR, margin expansion to 30% by 2029, WACC at 9% with component inputs, and terminal growth at 4%. Specificity is solid\u2014percentages, units, and horizons are given, and the Financials Snapshot aligns with the narrative for revenue and margin paths. Justification is partial: revenue CAGR references Q2 trends, terminal growth uses a GDP proxy, and WACC components are standard but lack capital structure detail or sourcing; the 25x EPS terminal multiple is not benchmarked to peers or history. Internal consistency has a key issue: the text applies both a 4% terminal growth rate and an exit multiple of 25x EPS, without reconciling methodologies. Sensitivities are limited; the report mentions potential revenue reduction of 5\u201310% and valuation swing of 15\u201320%, but these are not tied to model drivers in quantified scenarios or shown with valuation impact across cases. Given the unresolved terminal-method contradiction and the absence of robust sensitivity analysis on material drivers, the assumptions quality fits a Fair grade.",
