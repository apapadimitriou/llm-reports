    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are explicitly stated in the narrative and an assumptions table (revenue CAGR 30% for 2025\u20132029, operating margin 20%, WACC 10%, terminal growth 4%, and a FY25 product revenue base of $3.356B). Specificity is partial: magnitudes are given in percentages and the revenue CAGR has a clear horizon, but there is no granularity on tax rate, capex/reinvestment, SBC, or share count, and the valuation linkage (10x sales) is asserted without a transparent bridge. Justification is weak: growth is tied broadly to recent year-over-year rates from social media posts, WACC is labeled \u201cstandard for tech,\u201d terminal growth as a \u201cGDP proxy,\u201d and margin expansion is unsubstantiated by history/peers. Internal consistency appears mostly clean between the narrative and the appendix, though the \u201cimplies a 10x sales multiple\u201d is not reconciled to any model outputs and coexists with a stated inability to provide a fair value estimate. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for any material driver (growth, margins, discount rate), triggering a hard cap at Fair. Overall, assumptions are present and somewhat specific but thinly justified, with no stress testing.",
