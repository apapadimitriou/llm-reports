    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and a mostly cohesive narrative linking guidance, assumptions, and valuation. The Fair Value and Profit Drivers section aligns well with the Financials Snapshot (e.g., 7% revenue CAGR and margin expansion to 20% by 2029), and terminology (TPV, EPS, FCF) is used consistently across sections. Risks and Capital Allocation broadly reinforce the base-case by acknowledging competitive pressures and FCF volatility, which are also reflected in Bulls/Bears. However, temporal inconsistencies undermine coherence: the report date is April 29, 2025, yet the Analyst Note references Q2 2025 results and uses August 2025 sources as \u201crecent updates,\u201d creating a time-inaccurate framing. Additionally, the Economic Moat section cites Q2 2025 TPV and active account figures while referencing a 2024 source, which misaligns citations with the claims. These timing/citation mismatches force the reader to reconcile what is contemporaneous versus retrospective and detract from the smoothness of the argument. Despite these issues, cross-references among outlook, valuation, and risks are largely consistent, and there are no material contradictions between tables and narrative. Given the temporal inaccuracy guardrail, the report cannot score above fair even though much of the internal logic is sound.",

        "Economic Moat states \u2018TPV of $417 billion in Q2 2025\u2019 but cites a 2024 source [5], misaligning claim and citation timing.",
        "Fair Value assumptions (7% CAGR; margins to 20%) match the Financials Snapshot table and the stated FY25 EPS +8% guidance [6][7]."
