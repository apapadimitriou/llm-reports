    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report offers mostly restated, boilerplate observations (moat from near-duopoly, subscription stability, IHS Markit cross-sell, ESG/AI secular growth) and a standard DCF without novel drivers. There are two weak syntheses: linking FCF to an implied 3.7% yield to support capital returns, and quantifying a 10\u201315% potential ratings revenue impact from macro/issuance swings. These are modestly decision\u2011relevant but lack deeper mechanisms, catalysts, or monitoring signals. Valuation relies on conventional inputs (8% CAGR, 8% WACC, 4% terminal growth) and shows internal inconsistency (30x vs 46x P/E references), reinforcing the absence of unique insight. Peer specificity is limited to a superficial ESG risk comparison. Overall, with six insights classified as copied/restated and no original thesis, and with a valuation section lacking any novel driver, the hard caps apply and the originality merits a Fair grade rather than Good.",
