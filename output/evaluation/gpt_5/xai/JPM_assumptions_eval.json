    "summary_reasoning": "The report states most core modeling inputs clearly and near the forecasts they inform: revenue CAGR (2025\u20132029), loan growth, operating margin trajectory, WACC components, terminal growth, and an EPS bridge. Specificity is solid, with magnitudes, units, and time horizons tied to the financial forecast table that reconciles internally (revenues and margins track the 4% CAGR and 35%\u219238% margin path; the EPS bridge aligns with the 2025 EPS). However, justification is weak: drivers such as the 4% revenue CAGR, 3% loan growth, and +3pp margin expansion lack evidence from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or sourced management guidance beyond generic references. WACC inputs (RF 3%, ERP 6%, beta 1.1) and terminal growth (3%) are asserted without supporting sources or cross-checks to market conditions/peer parameters. Sensitivity analysis is limited to a single rate shock comment (100 bps cut \u2192 5\u201310% earnings hit) and does not quantify impacts on valuation or provide ranges for other material levers (NII/NIM, credit costs, margins). Several material assumptions are missing or opaque (tax rate, share count/buyback effect on EPS, long-run credit cost/NCOs, deposit/funding cost or NIM path). Despite internal consistency, the lack of robust evidence and thin sensitivity work keeps overall assumption quality at Fair.",
