    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly restatements of publicly available data (Q2 revenue/EPS/ARR/RPO, wide moat, subscription predictability) and a standard DCF with conventional assumptions. There are a couple of weak syntheses: comparing current 20x forward EPS to a 30x historical average to claim valuation attractiveness, and positing that Experience Cloud uptake can offset saturation in Creative Cloud. A third synthesis suggests ARR acceleration to 13\u201315% via AI premium features, but lacks mechanism, proof points, or catalysts. The margin expansion to 48% attributed to AI efficiencies is stated without a company-specific operational driver or quantification. Decision relevance is modest: the valuation comparison and segment offset thesis provide some direction, but they are not supported by timelines, monitoring signals, or peer contrasts. No original thesis with clear causal links, numbers, and catalysts is present. The valuation section lacks a novel driver, triggering a cap at Fair. Overall, originality is limited; the analysis leans on generic narratives about AI, switching costs, and recurring revenue rather than unique, company-specific insights.",
