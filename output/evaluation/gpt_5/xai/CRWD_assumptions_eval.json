    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report clearly states the core DCF inputs near the valuation: 25% revenue CAGR FY2026\u2013FY2029, operating margin expansion from 25% to 30% by FY2029, terminal growth of 10%, a 10% WACC with component parts, and an EPS bridge to $5.00 by FY2029. Specificity: Assumptions include concrete magnitudes, units, and time horizons, and most figures reconcile to the forecast table. Justification: Support is partial. Revenue CAGR is linked to ARR trends and guidance; terminal growth is asserted as \u201caligned with market growth,\u201d but no rigorous cross-check versus long-run economics is provided. WACC components (7% risk-free, 6% ERP, beta 1.2) are stated without sources or capital structure rationale; the share count/dilution underpinning the EPS bridge is opaque. Consistency: There is at least one numeric inconsistency\u2014text targets 30% operating margin by FY2028, while the model reaches 30% in FY2029. WACC at 10% alongside \u201cminimal debt\u201d is not reconciled with the implied cost of equity. Sensitivity: No quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis is provided for major levers (growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth). Given the lack of sensitivities and the noted inconsistency, the assumptions quality is capped at Fair despite reasonable explicitness and specificity.",
