    "summary_reasoning": "The report makes several key inputs explicit and proximate to the forecasts (revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, WACC, terminal growth, FY2025/2029 revenue, EPS), and provides specific magnitudes with time horizons. However, justification is weak: drivers are largely attributed to \u201cAI and cloud\u201d tailwinds without multi-year historical evidence, peer benchmarks, or sourced parameter derivations (e.g., WACC and terminal growth rationales are cursory). Internal consistency is problematic with at least two numeric contradictions: the stated 20% revenue CAGR (and 20\u201325% growth through 2027) conflicts with the Financials Snapshot and the implied 2025\u20132029 growth path to $16.1B (~15% CAGR), and WACC at 9% is inconsistent with a 10% cost of equity and \u201cno debt.\u201d Stress-testing is limited but present: revenue downside of 10\u201315% and a 2% WACC swing changing valuation by 20% are quantified; yet there is no sensitivity on terminal growth, margins, or share count, nor valuation impacts across scenarios. Several material assumptions are missing/opaque (tax rate, capex/working capital, share count/dilution). Given the contradictions and incomplete sensitivities, the quality of assumptions is poor under the stated decision rules.",
