    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report has a clear structure and mostly consistent narrative: it opens with Q1 2025 performance, links AI/capex to the outlook, and carries those themes through Bulls/Bears, Moat, and Risks. Cross-referencing is generally solid: Q2 revenue guidance, DAU growth, and elevated 2025 capex recur across sections and align with the Financials Snapshot, where near-term FCF is slightly below 2023, consistent with \u201cpressure near-term free cash flow.\u201d Language is mostly clear, and terminology (FoA, DAU, moat) is used consistently. However, there is a notable internal contradiction in the valuation section that forces a downgrade: the report states a 15x forward P/E at fair value while also claiming an implied 25x P/E, without reconciling these figures. There is also a minor inconsistency between \u201caverage operating margin 40%\u201d in the narrative and a 41% average margin assumption in the appendix. Repeated \u201cInsufficient data\u201d placeholders (e.g., 2024 actuals) weaken coherence and force the reader to accept ad hoc assumptions (e.g., 2024 EPS = $18) without explicit bridging to the forecasts. Citation alignment is somewhat shaky where a Q1 press release is cited for global market share. Despite these issues, section flow is generally logical and risks are tied back to the uncertainty rating, making the report understandable with some effort, but internally noisy.",
    "evidence": [
        "Fair Value and Profit Drivers: \u201cBy 2029, EPS reaches $40, implying a forward P/E of 15x at fair value\u2026 Implied multiples include \u2026 25x P/E,\u201d creating an unreconciled contradiction.",
        "Fair Value vs Appendix: \u201cOperating margins are expected to average 40%\u201d (narrative) vs \u201cAvg Op Margin 41.0%\u201d (Appendix Assumptions).",
        "Economic Moat: cites [1] for \u201cover 20%\u201d global ad market share; [1] is a Q1 results press release, not a market share source, weakening citation alignment."
