    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report largely recaps public Q1\u201925 results, guidance, and well-known attributes (network effects, AI-driven ad targeting) without developing unique, decision-relevant angles. Among six candidate insights identified, all are generic restatements rather than syntheses or original theses. There are no explicit causal linkages that combine multiple company-specific data points into a novel conclusion (e.g., AI inference cost curve vs. capex cadence vs. FoA margin trajectory, or WhatsApp click-to-message monetization ramp vs. ARPU). The valuation section is a boilerplate DCF with standard inputs (15% CAGR, ~40% margins, 9% WACC, 3% terminal) and no novel drivers, mechanisms, or catalysts; thus it fails the originality bar and triggers a hard cap. Assertions about AI benefits, capex pressuring FCF, and regulatory/TikTok risks are widely cited sector themes and not substantiated with company-specific, quantified pathways or timelines. Decision relevance is low: while some statements touch on capex/FCF and a $600 FVE, they do not provide differentiated, testable hypotheses or monitoring signals. No peer-relative contrasts or unique business-unit diagnostics are offered. Per decision rules: zero syntheses and zero original theses lead to a Poor rating.",
