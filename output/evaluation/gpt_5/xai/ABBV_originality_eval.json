    "summary_reasoning": "The report largely restates public information (EPS headlines, Humira erosion, pipeline offset narrative) and presents a boilerplate DCF. I identify two weak syntheses: linking EPS resilience to portfolio strength despite Humira, and projecting 2025\u20132027 growth with margin stabilization driven by Skyrizi/Rinvoq ramp. However, there is no strong original thesis with a clear mechanism, quantified implications tied to catalysts, or peer-specific contrasts. The valuation section uses standard assumptions (4% revenue CAGR, 7% WACC, 2% terminal growth) without introducing novel drivers (e.g., product-specific pricing dynamics, IRA negotiation timelines, or cost synergies) and thus triggers a hard cap at Fair. Decision relevance is modest: a fair value target and mid-term growth/margin outlook are company-specific but generic and lack actionable monitoring signals or timing (trial readouts, label expansions, patent events). Multiple insights are generic restatements and headline repeats, with no evident copying beyond paraphrasing sourced news. Overall, originality is limited, with at most one to two weak syntheses and no original theses.",
