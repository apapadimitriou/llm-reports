However, justification is weak: the 4% CAGR is attributed loosely to asset-cap removal, WACC 9% and terminal growth 2.5% rely on generic rationales without cited data, and margin expansion lacks peer or historical benchmarking. Specificity is partial\u2014major magnitudes are stated, but critical banking drivers (NII/NIM path, tax rate, share count, credit loss rates) are absent or only qualitatively discussed. Consistency is marred by an EPS bridge that does not mathematically reconcile to the stated 2029 EPS, though revenue/margin paths align with tables and the 2025 P/E implication is coherent. Sensitivity analysis is missing; risks are noted qualitatively without quantified ranges for material levers (rates/NIM, credit costs, margins). Under the hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivities and a numeric inconsistency limit the grade to Fair despite some clear inputs.",
