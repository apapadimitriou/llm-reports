    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are stated explicitly and near the forecasts they inform (revenue CAGR, segment growth, margin path, WACC inputs, terminal growth). Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and the 2025\u20132029 horizon are given, plus an EPS bridge. However, justification is weak: the report provides minimal evidence tying these inputs to multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited sources; the cited news items do not substantiate the 25% data center growth, margin expansion to 25%, or the WACC construction. Internal consistency has at least one numeric contradiction: the fair value implies \u201cforward P/E of 30x 2026 EPS\u201d while the table shows 2026 EPS of 3.5, making 185/3.5 \u2248 53x. Several material drivers (tax rate, capex/DA, working capital, share count/dilution) are missing or opaque despite FCF/EPS outputs. Sensitivity is limited: a 10\u201315% potential revenue cut and \u00b130% valuation swing are mentioned but not tied to model mechanics or fair value impacts, with no scenarios on WACC, margins, or terminal growth. These issues cap the assumptions quality at Fair under the stress-testing and contradiction rules.",
