    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are explicit and proximate to the forecasts: revenue CAGR (2025\u20132029), margin trajectory, WACC components, and terminal growth are stated in the Fair Value section and Appendix. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and time horizons are provided (e.g., margins from 30% to 35% by 2029; WACC 8.5% with beta 0.9, Rf 4%, ERP 5%). However, justification is weak: the 4% revenue CAGR is based on a single quarter\u2019s 7.3% y/y growth, terminal growth cites a generic industry average, and WACC inputs lack sourced evidence; historical actuals (2022\u20132024) are marked \u201cinsufficient data,\u201d reducing context. Internal consistency has a notable issue: \u201cBulls Say\u201d claims 35% operating margin by 2027, while the forecast table shows 32% in 2027 and 35% only by 2029. Stress-testing is absent: there are no quantified sensitivities or scenarios for material levers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth), only qualitative risk talk. Material assumptions around share count, tax rate, capex/working capital (which underpin FCF) are missing or opaque. Given explicitness and specificity but weak justification, a contradiction, and no quantified sensitivities, the assumptions quality merits a Fair grade.",
