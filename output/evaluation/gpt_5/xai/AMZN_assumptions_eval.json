    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report states several core drivers near the forecasts they inform, including revenue CAGR, margin path, WACC inputs, terminal growth, and an EPS bridge. Specificity: Magnitudes, units, and time horizons are generally clear (e.g., \u201c10% from FY 2025\u20132029,\u201d \u201coperating margin to 12% by 2029,\u201d WACC components). Justification: Support is weak; revenue growth is loosely tied to one quarter\u2019s guidance, and segment growth rates (e-commerce 8%, AWS 15%), WACC (8% with 6% Rf, 5% ERP, beta 1.2), and terminal growth (4%) lack evidence from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or sourced studies. Consistency: There is a numeric contradiction between the narrative and the table regarding 2029 revenue ($1,050B in text vs $981B in the table), undermining internal coherence. Sensitivity: No quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis is provided for material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth, capex); risks are discussed qualitatively only. Given one contradiction and absent quantitative sensitivities, assumptions quality caps at Fair despite reasonable specificity. The report also omits several material assumptions (tax rate, share count/dilution, capex levels), reducing completeness and auditability.",
