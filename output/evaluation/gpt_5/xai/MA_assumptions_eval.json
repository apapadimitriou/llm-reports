    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely explicit and specific (clear revenue CAGR, margin path, WACC inputs, terminal growth, and an EPS bridge), and they are proximal to the valuation section. However, justification is weak/partial\u2014claims rely on recent quarterly trends and general references without multi-year evidence or peer benchmarks. Internal consistency suffers from multiple numeric contradictions: 2026 EPS is stated as $15.90 in text versus $17.2 in the table; forward P/E is cited as 32x in one place and 33x in another; margin target is 58% by 2029 in text versus 58.5% in the table. Sensitivity/scenario analysis is absent for material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth), with only qualitative risk discussion; this violates the stress-testing pillar. Key drivers like share count, tax rate trajectory, and capex/working capital assumptions are missing or opaque relative to the FCF forecasts. Given the contradictions and lack of quantified sensitivities, the assumptions quality falls to Poor under the stated decision rules.",
