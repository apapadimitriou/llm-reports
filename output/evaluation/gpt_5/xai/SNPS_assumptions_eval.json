    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are explicitly stated and proximate to the forecasts (revenue CAGR, margin path, WACC, terminal growth, and EPS bridge). Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons (FY2025\u2013FY2029) are provided, and the financials table reconciles to most stated assumptions. However, justification is partial at best: growth rates are attributed broadly to AI/5G and backlog/IP without rigorous historical back-testing, peer benchmarks, or cited sources for the numeric parameters (e.g., WACC inputs, terminal growth). Internal consistency is marred by a notable contradiction: a 35x forward P/E on 2026 EPS conflicts with the $650 FVE and the 2026 EPS in the table. Sensitivity analysis is limited; the report only mentions a \u00b120% valuation sensitivity to revenue and a qualitative 10\u201315% downturn impact, with no quantified scenarios for other material levers (margin, WACC, terminal growth). Given the single contradiction and lack of robust sensitivity/scenario analysis across drivers, the assumptions quality fits the Fair category per the decision rules.",
