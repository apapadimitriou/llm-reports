    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected sections (cover block, contents, analyst note, business description, strategy/outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, financials snapshot, ESG, appendix, sources). However, the Financials Snapshot lacks historical data (marked \u201cinsufficient data\u201d for FY2022\u2013FY2024) and omits core medtech KPIs (e.g., organic growth, segment mix, gross margin, R&D as % sales, geographic mix, procedure volumes/pipeline milestones), triggering a hard cap to Fair. Valuation provides a DCF with explicit revenue and margin drivers and a simple EPS bridge, linking drivers to value, but without sensitivity/scenario analysis. Evidence integration is inconsistent: some key claims (ESG ratings, balance sheet quality/investment-grade status, buybacks/dividends) are uncited; one source is vaguely dated, and the ESG section explicitly notes missing citations. Peer/industry context is mentioned (Medtronic, Abbott) but lacks benchmarking tables or comparative metrics. There is minor redundancy (Q2 growth and macro/regulatory risks reappear across sections with limited new depth). Overall, while the structure is complete and some drivers are linked to valuation, missing historicals, absent sector KPIs, thin peer benchmarking, and citation gaps constrain comprehensiveness.",
