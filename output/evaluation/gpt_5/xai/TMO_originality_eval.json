    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains primarily restatements of public information (Q2 stock decline, $2B U.S. investment, \u2018world leader\u2019 positioning, secular trends) with minimal interpretive commentary and no clear causal synthesis linking multiple data points to a unique, decision-relevant conclusion. There are no original theses with mechanisms, quantification, or catalysts/timelines. The valuation section is entirely missing, with \u2018insufficient data\u2019 cited throughout and no novel drivers or frameworks to bridge the gap. Assertions about moat and risks are boilerplate and applicable across the sector, lacking company-specific angles or peer comparisons. Even the one quantified element (10\u201320% valuation swings) is unsupported and not tied to a measurable pathway. As a result, decision relevance is near zero: no actionable triggers, monitoring signals, or segment-level dynamics (e.g., CDMO capacity utilization, instrument replacement cycles, or diagnostics reimbursement changes) are analyzed. With zero syntheses or original theses, and multiple copied/generic restatements, the report meets the criteria for a Poor originality grade.",
