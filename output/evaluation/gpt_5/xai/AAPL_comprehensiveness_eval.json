    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections (cover/contents, Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy/Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation, Risk, Capital Allocation, Financials, ESG, Appendix, Sources). Several sections have reasonable depth: the Analyst Note includes segment and geographic highlights; Strategy/Outlook and Moat articulate drivers; Valuation provides a DCF with explicit revenue/margin/WACC assumptions and an EPS bridge; Risks and Capital Allocation are addressed. However, comprehensiveness is constrained by gaps and inconsistent evidence. The Financials Snapshot lacks core sector-specific KPIs (e.g., installed base, services mix, segment breakdown, iPhone units/ASPs, gross margin), and FY2024 actuals are missing. The cover block omits last close and market cap, undermining completeness. Sourcing relies on social media posts and \u201cinferred\u201d data; multiple material claims are uncited or outdated. Peer benchmarking is absent (aside from a tangential ESG comparison), and no scenario/sensitivity analysis is provided. There is some repetition of the \u201cservices strength\u201d theme across sections without incremental depth. While the valuation section does link operating drivers to fair value, the combination of missing sector KPIs and sourcing issues caps the report at Fair under the hard rules.",
