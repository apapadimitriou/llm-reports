    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear structure and a mostly connected narrative: it opens with performance context, frames the wealth-management transformation, and ties assumptions to a $135 fair value with a supporting table. Transitions generally point forward (e.g., Analyst Note to Fair Value), and the 5% revenue CAGR and margin expansion are echoed across the Strategy, Fair Value, and Appendix sections. However, several internal inconsistencies undermine coherence. The most notable is the 2025 EPS: the Analyst Note states an updated forecast of $7.50, but the Fair Value section\u2019s EPS bridge and the Financials Snapshot table both show $7.30, leaving the reader to reconcile conflicting base-case figures. ROIC claims also conflict: Strategy & Outlook projects ROIC at 10% by 2026, while the Financials Snapshot forecasts 6% in 2026; Economic Moat cites a historical five-year ROIC average of 8% despite tabled actuals of 3.5%\u20134.5% for 2022\u20132024. Source alignment and timing introduce additional noise: \u201cearly indications\u201d for Q2 2025 are linked to a July 2025 CNBC article, even though results are said to be pending as of the June 29 report date, and regulatory risk magnitudes rely on vague \u201cposts found on X.\u201d Bulls/Bears are not explicitly reconciled with valuation sensitivities (e.g., NIM compression vs. margin expansion). These issues warrant a fair grade despite otherwise solid structure.",
