    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are stated (revenue CAGR, margin path, WACC, terminal growth, EPS growth via buybacks), but justification is weak and internal consistency is poor. Assumptions are explicit and proximate to forecasts, with units and horizons (e.g., 5% CAGR to 2029, WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 3%). However, the report provides limited evidence: references to Q2 trends and sector averages without multi-year historical reconciliation, peer benchmarks, or cited parameter sources. Specificity is partial: magnitudes are given, but share count/buyback magnitude, tax rate, capex/reinvestment and working capital assumptions are absent, and WACC components are not broken out. Internal contradictions undermine coherence: 2029 revenue is stated as $12.9B in text vs $12.6B in the table; 20% margin is targeted by 2027 in one section vs 2029 in the model; 2029 EPS is $6.50 in text vs $6.40 in the table. No quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis is provided for material levers (revenue growth, margin, WACC/terminal rate), triggering the hard cap and reinforcing a Poor grade. Overall, assumptions feel selective and under-justified, with multiple unresolved numeric mismatches.",
