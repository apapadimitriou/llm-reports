    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely unstated and opaque. The report explicitly shows no quantitative inputs for core drivers: the Financials Snapshot is entirely N/A, and the Key Valuation Assumptions Table lists Revenue CAGR, Op-Margin, WACC, and Terminal Growth as N/A. Explicitness is therefore absent near the forecasts they would inform. Justification is missing\u2014there is no use of multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited quantitative sources to support any revenue, margin, tax, capex, or valuation assumptions. Specificity is effectively none: there are no magnitudes, units, or time horizons tied to forecasts; only a vague \u201cnext 3\u20135 years\u201d qualitative outlook is noted, without quantification. Internal consistency is clean primarily because the report declines to provide numbers; there are no contradictions, but also no reconcilable figures. Sensitivity analysis is entirely absent; there are no quantified ranges or scenarios for material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth, FX, share count). Given the lack of explicit, justified, specific, and stress-tested assumptions\u2014and the complete omission of valuation/forecast inputs\u2014the quality of assumptions is Poor under the decision rules.",
