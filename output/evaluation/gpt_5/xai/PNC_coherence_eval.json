    "reasoning": "The report presents a coherent arc from Q2 2025 results to strategy, valuation, risks, and capital allocation, with generally consistent assumptions tied across sections. The valuation narrative (3% revenue CAGR, margins rising from 26% to ~28\u201330%, WACC 9.5%) aligns cleanly with the Financials Snapshot and Appendix, and the EPS bridge matches the table (2025E EPS 13.8). The risk discussion (rate sensitivity, regulatory capital) connects to the capital allocation section (SCB, CET1, dividend), and Bulls/Bears are partially reflected in the valuation via higher provisions. Language is mostly clear, and transitions are adequate. However, there are temporal and citation alignment issues that undermine coherence. The Economic Moat and Business Description repeatedly cite [5] for \u201cas of 2024 filings\u201d and \u201crecent filings,\u201d but [5] is explicitly noted as April 2023, which is time-inaccurate. The Analyst Note also dates the Zacks estimate change to Aug 5 while the cited source is Aug 9, introducing a mismatch. ESG references acknowledge an absent direct source link, further weakening citation coherence. These issues trigger an auto-downgrade under the rubric\u2019s temporal guardrail, even though the core numeric narrative is internally consistent.",
