    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear, structured arc from recent results to strategy, valuation, and risks, with generally smooth transitions and consistent terminology (ARR, RPO, NGS). The core financial assumptions align well across sections: the Fair Value narrative, Appendix, and Financials Snapshot all reinforce a 13% revenue CAGR and operating margin expansion to 32% by FY2029, culminating in EPS of $11.00. The base-case valuation narrative acknowledges and incorporates risks raised in Bears (billings deceleration, competition, macro), which supports coherence across sections. Dates and temporal claims are internally consistent, and the fair value math (P/E at $195 using FY2025 EPS) checks out. However, there are rough edges. The Analyst Note has an editorial glitch around SOCaaS that breaks flow, and the Q3 commentary is vague (\u201cspecific metrics were not fully detailed\u201d), weakening connective tissue to subsequent sections. More notably, some citations appear misaligned: industry growth rates and cloud security CAGR are attributed to a generic ticker page, and Economic Moat metrics (customer lifetime value, retention) are referenced to sources unlikely to contain those figures, which introduces noise. Despite these issues, the narrative is cohesive, with most sections cross-referencing each other and supporting the valuation framework, warranting a Good rather than Fair grade.",
