    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are explicit and concentrated in the valuation sections, with clear numerical inputs for revenue growth (2025\u20132029 CAGR), margins, WACC, terminal growth, and valuation multiples. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and the forecast horizon are stated, and an EPS bridge links quarterly EPS to annual forecasts. However, justification is partial: the 9% revenue CAGR is loosely extrapolated from a single quarter\u2019s 10% growth; the 60% margin, 8% WACC, and 3% terminal growth lack evidence from multi-year history, peers, or cited sources. Internal consistency is marred by an unresolved contradiction between the narrative EPS target for 2029 (\"$16.50\") and the forecast table (\"16.1\"), and there is no reconciliation. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers (volumes/ADV, margins, WACC, or terminal growth), triggering the hard cap at Fair. Several important drivers (tax rate, capex, share count, working capital) are missing or opaque, and valuation multiples (PE 20x, EV/EBITDA 15x) are asserted without benchmarking. Overall, while the inputs are stated and proximate to the model, they are weakly justified and not stress-tested.",
