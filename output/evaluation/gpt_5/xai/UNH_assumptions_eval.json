    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s core assumptions are explicit and located near the valuation section, with clear magnitudes, units, and horizons (e.g., revenue CAGR 2025\u20132029, margin path, WACC components, terminal growth). Specificity is solid: drivers such as \u201c4% membership growth\u201d and \u201c3% pricing increases\u201d are quantified, and the operating margin trajectory is reconciled to the forecast table. However, justification is only partial: while sources are cited for recent results and guidance, the model\u2019s key parameters (7% CAGR, 3% terminal growth, 7.5% WACC) lack robust evidence tied to multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or market data beyond general references. Internal consistency has at least one contradiction: the narrative EPS path reaches $40.00 in 2029, whereas the table shows $37.0, and there is no reconciliation. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material levers (revenue/membership, margins/MLR, WACC, terminal growth), which caps the grade at Fair. Important drivers like tax rate, capex, and share count/buyback pacing are not stated, leaving parts of the EPS and DCF bridge opaque.",
