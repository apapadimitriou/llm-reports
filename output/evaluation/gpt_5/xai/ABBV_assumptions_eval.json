    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: Core valuation drivers are clearly stated and proximate to forecasts (Revenue CAGR 4% 2025\u20132029, operating margin path 45%\u219247%, WACC 7%, terminal growth 2%), with an Appendix repeating key inputs and a forecast table. Specificity: Assumptions include magnitudes, units, and horizons; the EPS bridge quantifies component impacts. Justification: Weak. The 10% immunology growth, flat oncology, WACC (beta 0.6, cost of debt 4%), and terminal growth (2%) lack support from multi-year history, peer benchmarks, or cited evidence. The buyback impact ($0.30 EPS, $5B/yr) is not reconciled to share count or price. Consistency: Mostly consistent between narrative and tables, but there is a discrepancy between \u201cmargins should stabilize around 45%\u201d and the modeled improvement to 47% by 2029, and pervasive \u201cinsufficient data\u201d undermines auditability. Sensitivity: Limited. The only quantified sensitivity is a generic \u201c\u00b120% to revenue assumptions\u201d; there are no scenario ranges for other material levers (margin, WACC, terminal growth, share count). Given weak justification and minimal sensitivity analysis, the assumptions merit a Fair grade under the decision rules.",
