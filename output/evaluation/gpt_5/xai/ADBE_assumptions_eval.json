    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key drivers are stated and numerically specific (revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, WACC inputs, terminal growth, EPS path), which supports explicitness and specificity. However, justification is weak: revenue growth nods to FY25 guidance, but margin expansion to 48%, terminal growth of 4%, and especially an 8.5% WACC (with rf 7%, ERP 6%, beta 1.1) lack reconciliation to history, peers, or a coherent capital structure. Sensitivity analysis is effectively absent; the report offers no quantified scenarios or ranges on major levers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth) or their valuation impact, only a generic \u201c20% valuation swing,\u201d failing the stress-test criterion. Internal consistency is compromised by at least two contradictions: (1) the fair value \u201cimplying 22x FY26 EPS\u201d conflicts with the report\u2019s own FY26 EPS ($23.0), which would equate to ~17.4x at a $400 target; and (2) a net-cash balance sheet implies WACC should approximate COE (~13.6% from the report\u2019s own rf/ERP/beta inputs), not 8.5%, absent substantial cheap debt weighting. Several material assumptions are missing or opaque (tax rate, capex/working capital, share count trajectory), and some sources are flagged as \u201cinsufficient data.\u201d Given contradictions and lack of driver-level sensitivities, the assumptions quality is poor under the stated decision rules.",
