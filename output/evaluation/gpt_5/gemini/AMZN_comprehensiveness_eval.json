    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections, including a detailed Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation (DCF with WACC, revenue CAGR, terminal margin), Risks, Capital Allocation, Financials Snapshot, ESG Risk, and Sources. The proportional depth is reasonable, with sector-relevant discussion of AWS, advertising, retail logistics, and regulatory risks. However, comprehensiveness is impaired by the Financials Snapshot\u2019s generic metrics: it lacks core sector KPIs for Amazon\u2019s model (AWS revenue/margin, advertising revenue, third\u2011party seller mix, Prime membership, segment margins). Forecasts for FCF and ROIC are omitted, and there is no segment-level historical/forecast detail. Evidence integration is inconsistent; many material figures (Q2 revenue/EPS, advertising revenue, capex, FCF) are not cited in-text despite a long sources list. Valuation links operating drivers to assumptions qualitatively, but there is no peer benchmarking, scenario/sensitivity analysis, or valuation bridge by segment. The capex/AI investment theme is repeated across Analyst Note, Strategy, Risk, and Capital Allocation with limited incremental depth, contributing to redundancy. These gaps, especially missing sector KPIs and uncited claims, cap the grade at Fair.",
