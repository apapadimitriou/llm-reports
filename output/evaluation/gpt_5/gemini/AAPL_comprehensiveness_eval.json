    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is well-structured and covers nearly all expected sections: Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy & Outlook, Bulls/Bears, Economic Moat, Valuation & Profit Drivers, Risk & Uncertainty, Capital Allocation, ESG, Financials Snapshot, and an Appendix/Glossary with assumptions and extensive sources. Valuation is explicitly tied to operating drivers (Services growth >10%, iPhone ASP/mix, gross margin expansion to ~50%, WACC inputs), and risks include quantified tariff downside (~15% net), indicating proportional depth. Capital allocation and ESG are addressed with concrete data. However, the Financials Snapshot lacks core, sector-appropriate KPIs for consumer hardware/platforms: no product/segment breakdown (Products vs Services), no iPhone units/ASPs, installed base, subscription counts, segment gross margins, or regional mix. This triggers the KPI hard cap and limits comprehensiveness. Peer benchmarking is largely absent beyond a narrow ESG risk table; there is no financial/operational peer comparison or relative valuation. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is not provided beyond a single tariff downside point. Sourcing is abundant but not consistently tied in-text to specific claims, with some duplications and tangential links. Redundancy is limited, and most sections add incremental detail. Overall, strong coverage and linkage on valuation and strategy, but missing multiple sector KPIs and peer/scenario analysis constrain the grade.",
