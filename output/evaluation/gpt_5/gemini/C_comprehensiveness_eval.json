    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers many core elements: an executive summary with rating/target, strategic transformation narrative, segment-level business description, competitive advantages (notably the Services network), capital allocation (CET1/SCB, buybacks, dividend), risks, a peer valuation comparison, and a valuation framework linking RoTCE progression to a P/TBV re-rating. Sources are generally cited throughout with in-text footnotes and a works-cited list. However, the Financials Snapshot is the weak link: while it presents a multi-year table, it is partially malformed and omits multiple bank-specific KPIs (no NIM, no charge-off/NCL or NPL metrics, no loan/deposit growth, and CET1 is discussed in text but absent from the table). This triggers the hard cap on comprehensiveness. The valuation section does link operating drivers (RoTCE improvement, capital returns) to the target multiple, and peer context is present, though some peer figures are noted as illustrative. There is no scenario/sensitivity analysis, no explicit Bulls/Bears section, and no ESG/controversies discussion. Overall, breadth is good, but missing KPIs in the financial snapshot and absent scenarios limit the report to Fair.",
