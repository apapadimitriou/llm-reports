    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains mostly restated or copied insights from public sources and management guidance, with one modest synthesis linking peer valuation spreads to profitability and limited multiple expansion. Much of the analysis reiterates standard talking points\u2014stress test success and dividend increase, asset sensitivity benefiting from higher-for-longer rates, macro/CRE risks, seasonality in expenses, and subdued investment banking fees\u2014without adding company-unique angles or mechanisms. The valuation section relies on a conventional excess return/DCF with consensus growth and a simple P/TBV uplift, offering no novel drivers (e.g., deposit beta trajectory, securities portfolio duration roll-off, or capital rule implications for ROTCE). Decision relevance is limited: while peer comparison and capital strength are company-specific, they lack actionable catalysts or quantified pathways beyond management\u2019s NII exit-rate guidance. Under the hard caps, the absence of novel valuation drivers and the predominance of generic restatements constrain the grade to Fair.",
