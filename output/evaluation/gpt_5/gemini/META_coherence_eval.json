    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear narrative arc\u2014from a HOLD initiation and AI-driven investment thesis, through Q2 2025 setup, segment analysis, modeling assumptions, and valuation\u2014supported by mostly consistent tables. Transitions are generally smooth: the CapEx \u2018shockwave\u2019 is explicitly tied to modeled margin compression and FCF, and risks reinforce the thesis (investment efficacy, regulation). Financial tables align with the narrative: modeled CapEx of $70B in 2025 and $90B in 2026 drives lower FCF and GAAP margin compression, matching both the Summary and Detailed Projections. However, there is a material internal inconsistency in the ESG section: the stated \u201c2nd percentile\u201d placement conflicts with the rank of 925/936, which indicates near-bottom positioning. This contradiction triggers a hard cap to fair. Minor coherence rough edges include the use of \u201cNTM\u201d multiples in a year-by-year historical/forecast table without clear anchoring, and a slight temporal awkwardness in previewing Q2 while citing a Q2 results press release among sources (even though results data aren\u2019t used in the preview). Bulls/Bears are reasonably reconciled with the base-case HOLD and valuation. Overall, the argument is understandable and mostly connected, but the ESG percentile/rank mismatch and a few imprecise references reduce internal coherence.",
    "evidence": [
        "ESG section: \u201cMeta holds a \u2018High Risk\u2019 rating with a score of 32.8, placing it in the 2nd percentile \u2026 (ranked 925th out of 936 companies).\u201d The percentile/rank pairing is contradictory.",
        "Financial Model: CapEx $70B (2025E) and $90B (2026E) dovetail with modeled operating margin compression from 42% (2024A) to 38% (2025E) and 37% (2026E), and FCF declines (Summary + Detailed Projections).",
        "Q2 2025 Preview uses guidance and consensus appropriately, but sources list includes a Q2 results press release, creating a mild temporal mismatch in sourcing."
