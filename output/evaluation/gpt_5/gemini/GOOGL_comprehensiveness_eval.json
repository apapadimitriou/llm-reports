    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most core sections: a clear executive summary, detailed business description, strategy and regulatory outlook, segment deep dives, capital allocation, valuation (DCF and relative), financials (multi-year history and Q1 2025), and ESG with sources cited throughout. Evidence integration is generally strong, with in-text citations and a comprehensive works-cited list. The valuation ties operating drivers (Cloud and subscriptions growth, CapEx surge) to assumptions (WACC, terminal growth) and includes a brief sensitivity. However, the Financials Snapshot and segment analysis omit multiple sector-specific KPIs critical for internet advertising and cloud infrastructure: no Traffic Acquisition Costs, ad pricing/click metrics (CPC/CTR), YouTube subscriber/watch-time figures, or Cloud backlog/RPO/ARR/NRR. Peer benchmarking is limited to multiples without operating KPIs or moat analysis. There is minor inconsistency within the DCF implied per-share value ($215 vs $213). While breadth is good and redundancy minimal, the KPI omissions trigger the hard cap to Fair, reducing comprehensiveness on quantitative depth where it matters most for this sector.",
