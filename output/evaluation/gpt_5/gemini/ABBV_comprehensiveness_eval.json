    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers nearly all expected sections with solid breadth: cover block and contents, an analytical note, business description and strategy, bulls/bears, moat, valuation with DCF mechanics, risks, capital allocation, a financials snapshot, ESG, and an appendix with assumptions and sources. Evidence integration is generally consistent, with frequent in-text footnote markers and a comprehensive source list. The valuation section explicitly links operating drivers (Skyrizi/Rinvoq growth, margin expansion, segment trends) to the DCF assumptions and outputs, which is a strength. Capital allocation and risk sections provide sector-relevant debt, regulatory and M&A integration context. However, the Financials Snapshot is high-level and omits multiple core biopharma KPIs\u2014there is no multi-year product-level revenue breakdown (e.g., Humira, Skyrizi, Rinvoq), no R&D intensity metrics, and no pipeline/trial phase timelines or upcoming milestones in the snapshot. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is absent, and peer benchmarking appears only in the ESG section rather than competitive positioning. These gaps cap comprehensiveness at Fair despite otherwise strong coverage and linkages. Redundancy is limited and mostly appropriate reinforcement (e.g., Humira LOE, debt), not superficial repetition.",
