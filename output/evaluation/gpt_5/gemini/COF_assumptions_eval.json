    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report states a few key inputs (WACC 10.5%, synergy targets, integration costs \u201csomewhat higher\u201d than $2.8b, exchange ratio) and provides a DCF sensitivity grid, but most core operating drivers (loan/NII growth path, NIM trajectory, credit cost normalization, efficiency ratio path, tax rate, share count evolution) are not laid out near forecasts and FY25\u201326 figures are largely lifted from consensus. Justification: Rationale is weak; WACC is said to be CAPM-derived without components, terminal growth lacks justification, and synergy/eps-accretion claims aren\u2019t sourced in-text. Specificity: Some inputs are specific (magnitudes, dates for 2027 synergies; WACC) but many are qualitative or ranges without units or phasing; no quant for credit losses or NIM forward. Consistency: No clear contradictions between narrative and tables; numbers generally reconcile, though base terminal growth is only implied by the grid. Sensitivity: Only a valuation sensitivity on WACC/terminal growth is quantified; there is no scenario/sensitivity for material bank drivers like NIM, charge-offs/provisions, or synergy realization. Given partial explicitness, weak justification, and limited sensitivity, the assumptions quality merits a Fair grade.",
