    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains zero clear syntheses or original theses. Nearly all analysis restates management guidance, public filings, or widely used talking points (fortress balance sheet, scale, diversification, tech leadership). The valuation section relies on a standard excess-returns/DCF with CAPM inputs and generic normalization assumptions (ROTCE to 18.5%, terminal growth 3%), without introducing novel value drivers (e.g., deposit betas, asset duration, funding mix shifts, fee normalization mechanics). While some figures are specific (e.g., NII guidance ~$92B, CET1 15%, valuation premium to FVE, 3x TBV), they are not woven into decision-relevant causal insights or catalysts. The sole potentially actionable statement\u2014wait for a better entry given premium\u2014lacks a differentiated mechanism, catalysts, or timelines. No peer- or company-specific angles beyond public brand/moat assertions are provided. Given the absence of synthesis/original theses and heavy reliance on boilerplate phrasing and management data, the report\u2019s originality is low.",
