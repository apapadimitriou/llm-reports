    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear narrative arc: it starts with the rating upgrade and the SCB-driven capital return catalyst, then connects transformation progress to segment performance, forward estimates, valuation at ~1.0x TBV, and closes with risks. Transitions are mostly smooth, with explicit connective tissue (e.g., SCB reduction \u2192 excess capital \u2192 buybacks/dividends \u2192 valuation re-rating), and terminology such as TBVPS, RoTCE, NII is used consistently. Across sections, the thesis, capital/returns, and valuation are mutually reinforcing, and numbers like CET1 13.4% vs a new 11.6% minimum and TBVPS $94.16 align. The segment deep dive and financial model tie back to the transformation narrative in a coherent way.\n\nHowever, there are minor rough edges that prevent an \u201cexcellent\u201d grade. The financial summary table contains formatting glitches that impair readability and introduce ambiguity around 2026 net income/EPS rows. There is a mild tension in the forward model stating revenue \u201caligns\u201d with guidance at the higher end of $80\u201381 billion while also suggesting \u201cpotentially exceeding $84 billion,\u201d without explicitly reconciling the shift. Additionally, the inclusion of a Q2 2025 \u201cEarnings Preview\u201d reads temporally out of sync with later references to Q2-reported metrics, which slightly disrupts flow even if not contradictory. These issues are limited and do not materially undermine the overall coherence.",
