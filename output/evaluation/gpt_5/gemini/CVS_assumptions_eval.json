    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s core valuation and forecast assumptions are explicit and proximate to the model: revenue CAGR (4% over 2025\u20132029), 2025 revenue level, operating margin trajectory (4.2% to 4.5%), WACC components (6.8% with COE 7.9% and post-tax debt 5.3%), terminal FCF growth (2.5%), and 2025 EPS ($6.25). Specificity is solid\u2014magnitudes, units, and horizons are consistently stated and largely reconcile with the Financials Snapshot. However, justification is only partial: the growth and margin paths are supported by qualitative segment commentary (Aetna MBR recovery, Oak/Signify integration) rather than evidence-rich, quantified benchmarks, and WACC/terminal growth lack cited sources or parameter derivations. Internal consistency has a notable numeric contradiction: the $6.25 EPS is described as the \u201cmidpoint\u201d of a $6.00\u2013$6.20 guidance range. Sensitivity analysis is absent; risks are discussed qualitatively without quantified ranges or scenario impacts on valuation or EPS, triggering the hard cap at Fair. Material inputs like tax rate, capex/working capital drivers, share count, and segment-level MBR trajectory are missing or opaque, limiting auditability of the cash flow build.",
