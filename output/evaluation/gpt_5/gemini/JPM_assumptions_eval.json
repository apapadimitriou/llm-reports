    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation inputs are explicit and placed proximate to forecasts (revenue CAGR, ROTCE/CET1, operating margin range, COE components, terminal growth, EPS trajectory). Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and timeframes are provided, and several items reconcile to the Financials Snapshot (EPS path, margin trajectory). Justification is partial: some references to management guidance (NII, expenses) and to market norms (ERP, GDP-linked terminal growth) are offered, but major drivers like normalized ROTCE and revenue CAGR lack evidence tied to multi-year history or peer benchmarks; credit costs and tax rates are not stated. Consistency is mostly clean but a notable issue exists: the stated five-year revenue CAGR of ~4% is not supported by the table (which implies ~3.2\u20133.5%). Most material drivers lack stress-testing; there are no quantified sensitivities or scenario ranges for rates/NIM, credit losses, margins, or valuation parameters. Given the absence of quantitative sensitivity analysis and the minor internal mismatch on revenue growth, the assumptions quality merits a Fair grade.",
