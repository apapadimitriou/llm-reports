    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: Several core valuation/forecast inputs are clearly stated, including WACC (with components), terminal growth, revenue growth (FY25/26 and a 5\u2011yr ~10% CAGR), a 2025 capex level, and the share count used in the DCF. However, key operating assumptions (tax rate, consolidated margin path, Cloud margin path, buyback impact on share count) are not explicitly quantified. Justification: Capex is anchored to company guidance; terminal growth is tied to long-term GDP/inflation; WACC components are listed. Yet revenue growth and margin assumptions lack robust support from multi-year history/peer benchmarks or cited sources, and the risk parameters (ERP/beta) have no sourcing. Specificity: Inputs carry units and horizons where provided (WACC, capex, TGR, revenue), but operating margins are only qualitatively described and tax rate is absent. Consistency: A numeric discrepancy exists between the DCF narrative (~$215 per share) and the DCF table ($213 per share). Sensitivity: Only a single quantified sensitivity (WACC +50 bps \u21d2 ~$198) is provided; no scenario ranges for revenue/margins/capex/regulatory outcomes. Given the limited quant sensitivities and the internal discrepancy, the assumptions quality merits a Fair grade.",
