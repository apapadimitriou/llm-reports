    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are largely explicit and located near the forecasts (Fair Value and Profit Drivers; Appendix). Specificity is strong: key drivers are quantified with magnitudes, units, and time horizons (e.g., revenue CAGR, iPhone/Services growth, gross margin path, WACC components, terminal growth, exit operating margin). Justification is partial: some links to recent history (gross margin starting at Q2 FY25 47.1%) and general rationales (services mix, privacy-driven ecosystem, risk-free tied to government yields), but there is limited evidence from multi-year history or peer benchmarks and few cited sources anchoring growth/margin trajectories. Internal consistency has a measurable issue: the forecast table implies ~5.6% revenue CAGR FY25\u201329 versus stated 6\u20137%/6.5%, and this discrepancy is not reconciled. Sensitivity analysis is limited: tariffs are quantified (25% gross, ~15% net valuation downside), but other material drivers (Services growth, margins, WACC, terminal rate) lack quantified ranges or scenario impacts. Given the contradiction and narrow sensitivity coverage, the overall quality of assumptions meets the Fair standard rather than Good.",
