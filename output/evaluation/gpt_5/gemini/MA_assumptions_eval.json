    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness: The report states most key drivers near the forecasts they inform (revenue CAGR 11.5%, 2025 revenue growth ~12.5%, operating margin path, WACC 9.8%, terminal growth 4.0%, share count -3.5%), and ties them to the DCF and EPS bridge. Specificity: Assumptions include magnitudes, units, and horizons (2025\u20132029), with clear sub-drivers for revenue (cross-border, value-added services). Consistency: Figures largely reconcile between narrative and the forecast table; minor differences (e.g., margin to ~59.5% vs 59.8% in 2029) are not material. Justification: Partially supported\u2014WACC inputs cite the 10Y Treasury and Kroll ERP; revenue sub-drivers reference Q1-2025 trends and 2024 segment growth, and management guidance. However, terminal growth (4.0%), after-tax cost of debt (3.65%), and the margin expansion trajectory lack rigorous evidence/peer benchmarking, and the 3.5% share count reduction is assumed without price/authorization cadence detail. Sensitivity: No quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis on material levers (revenue growth mix, margins, WACC, terminal growth, buybacks), which triggers a cap at Fair. Several material DCF inputs (tax rate, capex/working capital drivers) are not articulated, leaving parts of free cash flow formation opaque.",
