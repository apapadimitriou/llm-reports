    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most core sections: an analyst note with thesis, earnings review, detailed strategy and moat (Aladdin/iShares), valuation (SOTP, DCF, relative), risks, and a financials snapshot with multi\u2011year forecasts. Evidence integration is generally strong, with in\u2011text footnotes tied to an explicit sources list; quarterly and strategic claims are well\u2011cited. The depth on private markets and technology strategy is proportional, and the valuation work is reasonably linked to segment drivers via 2026E EBIT and forecasted revenue/margin trajectories. However, key gaps limit comprehensiveness: the Financials Snapshot omits multiple core asset\u2011management KPIs (e.g., management fee rate/bps and performance fee metrics, net flows across segments) despite including AUM, revenue, EPS, and margins. Peer benchmarking is minimal (sector median P/E only, no named peers or comparative tables), and there is no scenario/sensitivity analysis. Capital allocation (dividends, buybacks, leverage/liquidity) and ESG/controversies are not addressed. Some redundancy appears where execution/integration risks and fee compression are repeated across thesis and risks without added depth. Given the hard cap for missing KPIs in the snapshot and absent peer/scenario work, the report earns a Fair for comprehensiveness.",
