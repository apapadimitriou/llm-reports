    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "Explicitness is mixed: the report does state several core drivers in a \u201cModeling Assumptions (FY25\u2013FY29)\u201d section and outlines valuation inputs (SOTP multiples, DCF WACC/terminal growth, relative P/E). Specificity is partial: margins have a numeric range (3.0\u20133.5%), EPS CAGR is quantified (11\u201312%), and WACC (7.1%) and terminal growth (2.5%) are explicit, but revenue growth is described in broad bands (\u201cmid-/high-/low-single-digit\u201d) rather than precise rates and lacks segment margin paths or share-count assumptions. Justification is weak-to-partial: revenue growth references consensus (~4.7%) and EPS CAGR aligns with management targets, but WACC, terminal growth, and valuation multiples lack evidence-based support or peer benchmarking tie-outs. Consistency is poor: there are multiple unresolved numeric contradictions (e.g., 2026 forward P/E cited as ~10.4x vs a table showing 9.31x; a 16.7x P/E elsewhere; and a \u201cRelative Valuation (Yields ~$340)\u201d that computes to ~$347). Sensitivity/stress testing is absent: no quantified scenarios for key drivers (medical cost/MCR, Evernorth margins/PBM economics, WACC/terminal growth, valuation multiples, or buyback pace). Given multiple contradictions and no sensitivities, the assumptions quality falls to Poor under the stated decision rules.",
