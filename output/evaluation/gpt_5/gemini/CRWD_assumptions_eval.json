    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are explicit and concentrated in the DCF section, with clear magnitudes, units, and horizons. Core drivers\u2014revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, FCF margin, WACC components, and terminal growth\u2014are stated near the valuation they inform. Justification is generally solid: growth ties to consensus and management\u2019s ARR target; WACC inputs (Rf, beta, ERP, capital structure, tax rate) are sourced or standard; relative multiple is benchmarked to peers/market. Specificity is strong, e.g., CAGR path to FY31 and non-GAAP margin to FY29. Internal consistency is mostly clean; a minor logic issue exists where WACC is reduced despite citing \u201cHigh\u201d uncertainty, which typically warrants a higher discount rate. Stress-testing is present via quantified bull/base/bear scenarios varying revenue CAGR, margins, and WACC with price target impacts, though sensitivities don\u2019t cover terminal growth, tax rate, or FCF margin. Some material assumptions (share count, capex/SBC detail) are missing or opaque. Overall, the inputs are explicit, specific, and reasonably justified, with partial quantified sensitivity analysis on key levers.",
