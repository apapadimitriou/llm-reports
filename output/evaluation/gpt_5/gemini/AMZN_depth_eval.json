    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by linking outcomes to mechanisms and embedding explicit, quantified assumptions. It explains retail margin gains through operational redesign (\u201cre-architect its fulfillment network\u201d) and frames AWS growth deceleration as supply-driven (\u201cnot constrained by a loss of demand\u201d, \u201cpower availability for data centers\u201d), not demand-driven\u2014an important causal distinction. Valuation rests on clear inputs (\u201cWACC of 10.3%\u201d, \u201cTerminal Growth Rate 3.0%\u201d), and growth assumptions are anchored to external reference points (consensus, industry benchmarks). It also quantifies near-term investment headwinds (\u201cprojected to exceed $100 billion in 2025\u201d), and identifies the mix shift to higher-margin businesses as the driver of margin expansion. However, inference quality is limited by the absence of quantified sensitivities or scenarios (e.g., no valuation impacts under alternative WACC/terminal growth, no AWS capacity-ramp timelines or margin ranges). While risks are discussed (execution, regulatory, macro) and uncertainty is acknowledged (Medium), the treatment is qualitative, without scenario probabilities or ranges. Actionability is present via a stated fair value and HOLD stance, but lacks conditional triggers. Overall, mechanisms and explicit assumptions are strong, quantification is used, but the lack of scenario/sensitivity analysis prevents an Excellent rating.",
