    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers almost all expected sections: a clear executive summary, business description, strategy and outlook (embedded in thesis), bull/bear drivers, competitive positioning/economic moat, detailed valuation (DCF plus relative), risk analysis, capital allocation, ESG, peer context, and a works-cited section. The valuation is well-articulated, with explicit operating driver assumptions (revenue CAGR, margin trajectory, FCF margin, WACC) and includes bull/base/bear scenarios\u2014strong linkage from drivers to value. Peer benchmarking appears with both qualitative and a small quantitative table. However, the Financials Snapshot is narrative and quarterly-focused; it lacks a multi-year historical and forecast table and omits several core SaaS KPIs (e.g., dollar-based net retention, subscription gross margin, RPO, CAC payback), despite including ARR, net new ARR, module adoption, renewal rate, and FCF margin. Sourcing is generally present but not fully consistent; at least one ESG citation appears mismatched, and some comparative multiples/figures are not directly sourced. There is a methodological inconsistency in lowering WACC while citing higher uncertainty. Redundancy is limited as the risk section adds modest new angles beyond the bear case. Given the missing core SaaS KPIs in the financial snapshot (\u22652 omissions), the report is capped at Fair despite otherwise strong breadth.",
