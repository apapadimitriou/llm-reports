    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are mostly explicit and numerically specified near the forecasts/valuation. The report states multi-year revenue growth rates, operating margin levels, and valuation inputs (WACC, terminal growth, and a P/E multiple) with clear units and horizons. Justification is partial: FY25 is anchored to company guidance and outer years to consensus; margin assumptions reference recent history, and WACC is a \u201cblend\u201d from data providers. However, evidence is thin for key valuation levers (e.g., no decomposition of WACC inputs, only generic rationale for terminal growth). Internal consistency is largely clean; the forecast uses ~46% non-GAAP margins while the DCF assumes a 45% long-term margin, which is not contradictory and is directionally reasonable. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers (growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth, AI monetization, buybacks), triggering a cap at Fair. Several important DCF drivers are missing or opaque (tax rate, reinvestment/capex, working capital, SBC/GAAP-to-FCF bridges, share count trajectory), which limits auditability and robustness. Overall, assumptions are explicit/specific but only moderately justified and not stress-tested.",
