    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth with clear causal mechanisms and explicit, quantified assumptions. It links strategy to outcomes (e.g., \u201cpivot toward higher-growth, higher-margin value-added services\u201d) and ties margin expansion to drivers (\u201ca favorable mix shift\u201d). Forecasts are grounded in segment dynamics (\u201cThis segment is forecast to be the fastest-growing\u201d and \u201cCross-border volume growth is expected to moderate\u201d), and the model includes a quantified EPS bridge and valuation outputs (implied P/E and EV/EBITDA). Data use is credible: a five-year DCF with \u201cWACC of 9.8% is derived from\u201d transparent inputs benchmarked to the 10-year Treasury and Kroll ERP, plus recent growth rates to support segment forecasts. However, the analysis lacks quantified sensitivity or scenario work on key variables (WACC/terminal growth, cross\u2011border volumes, regulatory outcomes, buyback pace). Risks are discussed qualitatively but not translated into ranges or downside cases. Actionability is present via a fair value target, drivers, and an EPS bridge, yet the implications aren\u2019t framed conditionally (no what\u2011if cases). Overall, strong mechanisms and explicit, partially benchmarked assumptions justify a Good grade, but absence of quantified scenarios and sensitivities prevents an Excellent rating. Verbatim excerpts: \u201cpivot toward higher-growth, higher-margin value-added services\u201d; \u201cWe project a five-year revenue CAGR of 11.5%\u201d; \u201cThis segment is forecast to be the fastest-growing\u201d; \u201cCross-border volume growth is expected to moderate\u201d; \u201cWACC of 9.8% is derived from\u201d; \u201ca favorable mix shift\u201d.",
