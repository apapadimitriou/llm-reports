    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers most expected equity research sections with meaningful depth for a biopharma company. It includes an Executive Summary, a well-developed Investment Thesis, detailed Financials (FY2024 results, Q1 2025, consensus FY2025), Capital Allocation, Valuation with explicit DCF assumptions and WACC breakdown, Risk Assessment, and ESG. Sector-appropriate KPIs are integrated: product-level sales (Mounjaro), prescription share (>60% new obesity Rx), volume growth, net price changes, gross margin, and operating margin trajectory. Evidence is consistently cited in-text and supported by a robust works-cited section. Valuation linkages from operating drivers (growth deceleration, price erosion, margin dynamics) to fair value are explicit, and a qualitative scenario analysis is present; peer context is addressed via relative multiples and market dynamics. Gaps include the absence of a dedicated Business Description and a comprehensive peer benchmarking table; the Financials Snapshot lacks a multi-year KPI table and peak sales by asset. Some repetition occurs between the thesis and risk sections. Overall, the scope is broad with strong evidence integration and driver-to-valuation linkage, but the missing descriptive background, detailed KPI tables, and limited benchmarking prevent an Excellent grade.",
