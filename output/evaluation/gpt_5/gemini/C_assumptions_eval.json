    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides several explicit, proximate assumptions for key drivers (revenue, NII, credit provisions, RoTCE, and the valuation multiple applied to TBVPS), which improves traceability. However, justification is largely qualitative or based on consensus, with limited evidence tying inputs to multi-year history or peer benchmarks. Specificity is mixed: some drivers have clear magnitudes and horizons (e.g., 2025/2026 revenue, NII, provisions, TBVPS), while others remain vague (efficiency ratio \u201cmid-60s to low-60s,\u201d buyback \u201cacceleration\u201d without cadence, no tax rate or share count path). Internal consistency is generally acceptable, though there is a minor inconsistency between referencing a prior $80\u201381B revenue range and \u201cpotentially exceeding $84B\u201d without reconciliation. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers (rates/NII, credit cost, margins, valuation), which triggers a hard cap at Fair. Overall, the assumptions are partially explicit and specific but weakly justified and not stress-tested, leaving the model\u2019s robustness limited.",
