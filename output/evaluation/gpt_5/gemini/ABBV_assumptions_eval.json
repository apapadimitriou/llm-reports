    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s key drivers are mostly explicit and proximal to the forecasts: revenue CAGR, product-level revenue for Skyrizi/Rinvoq, operating margin trajectory, WACC/COE components, and terminal growth are clearly stated with numeric magnitudes and horizons. Specificity is mixed\u2014several inputs are precise (e.g., WACC 7.8%, COE 8.6%, terminal growth 2.5%, >$31B Skyrizi/Rinvoq by 2027), but portfolio growth for Neuroscience/Oncology is described as \u201cmid-single-digit\u201d and Aesthetics as \u201clow-single-digit\u201d without exact figures. Justification is partial: revenue CAGR is tied to management guidance and Q1 performance, while terminal growth is linked to nominal global GDP; however, beta (0.50), ERP (8.6%), capital structure weights (83%/17%), and cost of debt lack cited, in-report empirical support. Internal consistency appears clean; narrative aligns with tables (e.g., operating margin reaching ~46% and P/E \u224816x on $195 FVE and 2025 EPS). Crucially, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for material levers (WACC, terminal growth, margin path, product revenues), triggering the hard cap at Fair. Some material drivers (capex, share count, effective tax rate trajectory) are missing or opaque.",
