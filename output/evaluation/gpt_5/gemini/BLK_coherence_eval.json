Transitions are generally smooth: the Q2 flow analysis explicitly motivates the strategic pivot, which then ties into the valuation and risks. The valuation section reinforces the thesis and references the forecasts and segment specifics, showing good cross-section linkage. However, at least one unaddressed internal contradiction and a couple of numerical tensions undermine coherence. Notably, the margin commentary states the forecast is \u201cslightly more conservative than management\u2019s\u2026 45% or higher,\u201d while the table projects 46.5% by 2029, which is not conservative relative to 45%. Additionally, the flows arithmetic (\u201c$68B net inflow,\u201d excluding a $52B redemption implies \u201capproximately $116B\u201d) is not reconciled with the stated numbers (simple addition suggests nearer to $120B), leaving the reader to infer adjustments. The stated average revenue growth of 9.5% versus table YoY series (which imply roughly ~9.9% average or ~8.9% CAGR) is also thinly explained. These issues trigger the hard-cap to fair despite otherwise strong structure and alignment of assumptions, tables, and narrative.",
