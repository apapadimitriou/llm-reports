    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth through clear causal reasoning, explicit assumptions, and extensive quantification. It explains drivers behind results and guidance changes, e.g., \u201cdriven almost entirely by lower sales of the COVID-19 vaccine\u201d and margin pressure \u201cprimarily due to $38 million in inventory write-downs.\u201d The narrative ties cost actions to outcomes (\u201cIf cost reductions were outpacing the revenue decline\u201d) and attributes guidance revisions to operational specifics (\u201ctiming of contracted deliveries to the United Kingdom\u201d). Assumptions are explicit and partly benchmarked: a \u201cWACC of 8.85% as a baseline\u201d and \u201cPoS estimates are informed by industry averages,\u201d with risk-adjusted NPVs and PoS percentages per asset. Quantification is robust across historicals, forecasts, and SOTP components. The treatment of uncertainty is strong qualitatively (regulatory headwinds, competitive dynamics), but sensitivity/scenario analysis remains unquantified; while the report states valuation is sensitive to PoS and discount rates, it does not provide ranges or scenario outcomes. Actionable implications are present via an Underperform rating, downside price target, and potential dilution risks. Overall, mechanisms and assumptions are clear and partly benchmarked, but the lack of quantified sensitivities/scenarios limits the grade to Good.",
