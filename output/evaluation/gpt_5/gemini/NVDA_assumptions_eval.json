    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation drivers are explicit and proximate to the forecasts: WACC (9.2%), terminal FCF growth (4.0%), revenue growth by year (FY26 54% to $201B; FY27/28 25%/15%; FY29 5%), operating margin path (64% peak to 62% by end), and tax rate (16.5%). Specificity is solid with magnitudes, units, and timeframes, and the narrative references management guidance and the China export-ban reversal to justify near-term revenue levels. However, justification is partial: the report offers limited evidence from multi-year history or peer benchmarks for longer-term growth/margin assumptions, and rate inputs (risk-free/ERP) lack cited sources. Internal consistency is generally clean; revenue and margin figures reconcile across narrative and the Financials Snapshot, with only minor presentation issues (explicit forecast period cited through FY2030 while the table displays through FY2029). Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers (revenue growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth, China exposure), invoking the hard cap at Fair. Important modeling components like share count impacts amid large buybacks, capex/working capital driving FCF, and segment/ASP mix are not stated, reducing completeness.",
