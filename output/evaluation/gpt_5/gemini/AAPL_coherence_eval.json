    "reasoning": "The report presents a clear narrative arc\u2014from a concise Analyst Note through Strategy/Outlook, Moat, Valuation, Risks, and Capital Allocation\u2014with consistent terminology (e.g., distinguishing gross vs. operating margins) and generally strong cross-references. The Services-led mix shift is carried through Strategy, Moat, and Valuation, and the tariff downside (gross vs. net) is quantified consistently between Analyst Note and Risk & Uncertainty. Assumptions in the DCF (risk-free rate, ERP, beta) coherently map to the stated WACC, and the exit operating margin matches the forecast table. However, there are notable internal inconsistencies that undermine coherence. Most materially, the revenue growth assumptions do not reconcile with the forecast table: the Appendix lists a FY25\u201329 revenue CAGR of 6.5% (and the narrative cites 6\u20137% through FY2029), yet the Financials Snapshot implies a markedly lower ~5.6% CAGR from 2025E to 2029E. This mismatch between assumptions and the model outputs constitutes an unaddressed contradiction. Additionally, the ESG section contains a minor but clear inconsistency in Apple\u2019s industry rank (286th in text vs. 285 in the table). While overall flow and linkage are solid, these conflicts trigger a hard cap to fair per the rubric. Absent these issues, the report would read as a cohesive, well-supported argument.",
