    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation-driving assumptions are stated explicitly in the DCF section, including revenue CAGRs by segment, margin trajectory, WACC components, and terminal growth. Specificity is mixed: some inputs have clear magnitudes and horizons (e.g., ~20% revenue CAGR through FY27, WACC 9.1%, terminal growth 3%), while others are vague (\u201cdouble-digit,\u201d \u201clow-single-digit,\u201d \u201ctoward 70%\u201d). Justification is partial: the report references management guidance and external WACC ranges, but provides limited historical/peer evidence tying >50% AI CAGR, double-digit software growth, and 70% margins to multi-year data or benchmarks. Internal consistency has a notable contradiction between narrative quarterly figures and the estimates table (Q2 FY25 numbers appear mismapped), triggering a cap at Fair. Sensitivity analysis is limited to a quantified WACC change (200 bps \u2192 15\u201320% valuation impact); there are no quantified scenarios for other material drivers like AI growth, software growth, or margins. Several important model inputs (tax rate, capex, share count trajectory) are missing or opaque, further limiting auditability.",
