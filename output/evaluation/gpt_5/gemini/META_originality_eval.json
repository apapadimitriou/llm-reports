    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains a clear, company-specific thesis on Meta\u2019s AI-driven CapEx cycle leading to a \u2018depreciation bomb\u2019 that suppresses GAAP EPS and FCF, plus several solid syntheses: (1) linking sequential growth moderation to potential multiple re-rating; (2) forecasting a slight EPS miss vs. consensus due to underestimated AI-related opex; and (3) contrasting Meta\u2019s capital intensity vs. peers to justify a more cautious multiple. These are decision-relevant, with concrete figures (e.g., $66\u201372B 2025 CapEx; modeled margin compression to 38%/37%) and near-term timing (H2 2025\u20132026). However, the report also includes multiple generic or restated elements (recap of management\u2019s \u201cfive pillars,\u201d boilerplate regulatory risks, and a standard DCF with generic WACC/terminal choices and sensitivity). Critically, the valuation section lacks a novel driver or mechanism beyond standard inputs, triggering a hard cap at Fair. Overall, there are 3\u20134 genuine syntheses (including one original thesis) but also \u22653 generic/restated insights and a boilerplate valuation, limiting the originality grade despite some strong, actionable analysis.",
