    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Assumptions are explicit and proximate to valuation: the report clearly lists WACC (10.3%), terminal growth (3.0%), a 5-year revenue CAGR (9.5%), and a terminal operating margin (15.0%), plus segment margin expectations for AWS and a 2025 capex figure. Specificity is solid: magnitudes, units, and horizons are provided for the main DCF inputs and profit drivers. Justification is partial: revenue CAGR is tied to consensus and margin expansion is linked to mix shift and retail efficiency, but WACC and terminal growth lack evidence and peer/market citations; terminal margin is asserted without quantified historical/peer support. Internal consistency appears acceptable; figures in the valuation section reconcile conceptually with the snapshot table, with only minor ambiguity around \u201ccurrent\u201d operating margin. However, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for material levers (WACC, terminal growth, margins, AWS growth), invoking the hard cap to Fair. Coverage of material drivers is incomplete: tax rate, share count, working capital, and longer-term capex trajectory are absent. Overall, explicit and specific inputs but weakly justified and not stress-tested.",
