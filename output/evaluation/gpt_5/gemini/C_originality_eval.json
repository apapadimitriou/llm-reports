    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains two to three clear syntheses and one original, company-specific thesis, notably linking the SCB reduction to increased excess capital and buyback cadence, and articulating how divestitures free trapped capital that is accretively redeployed into buybacks below TBV and high-RoTCE Services. It also offers a near-term, decision-relevant angle on Q2 upside/risks (Markets/NII strength vs tariff-driven credit costs) and quantifies capital buffers (CET1 13.4% vs 11.6% minimum, ~180 bps). However, several sections are generic restatements (segment overviews, \u201ccrown jewel\u201d moat language, standard peer benchmarking), and the valuation relies on a conventional P/TBV-to-TBV framework tied to achieving cost-of-equity RoTCE, with no novel driver or mechanism. Per hard caps, the presence of \u22653 generic restatements and a valuation section lacking originality limits the grade to Fair, despite some decision-relevant syntheses. Overall, the report moves beyond headlines in a few places but falls short of multiple unique, quantified theses with catalysts that would warrant Good or Excellent.",
