    "summary_reasoning": "Key valuation and forecast drivers are reasonably explicit, with several material inputs stated near the sections they inform (e.g., NII exit rate for Q4-25, provisions, expense trajectory, DCF COE and growth, P/TBV multiple and TBVPS). Specificity is partial-to-solid: magnitudes and horizons are given for NII ($15.5\u2013$15.7bn Q4-25), provisions ($1.6bn Q2E), and valuation inputs (COE 7.05% with components; LT earnings growth 7%; P/TBV 1.85x on TBVPS $27.71). Justification is mixed: some items cite management guidance or consensus, but others (the chosen P/TBV premium, LT growth rate, and COE components) lack cited sources or peer/market benchmarks beyond brief assertions. Internal consistency is mostly clean, though revenue labeling varies (net of interest expense vs total) without reconciliation. Critically, there is no quantified sensitivity/scenario analysis for material drivers (rates/NII, credit costs, expense path, multiples), which caps the grade at Fair under the hard caps. The report would improve with auditable ties to multi-year history/peers for each assumption and quantified sensitivities showing impact on EPS/valuation across rate, credit, and multiple scenarios.",
