    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by linking Meta\u2019s AI capex surge to financial outcomes, notably free cash flow and GAAP margins. It offers clear causal mechanisms\u2014depreciation from data center build-out will suppress reported earnings (\u201cvia accelerated depreciation\u201d; \u201csharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth\u201d). Inference quality is credible: Q2 top-line/EPS forecasts are tied to operating expense drivers (hiring and infrastructure ramp), and multi-year margin forecasts explicitly attribute compression to depreciation. Data use is extensive, with quantified assumptions for revenue growth, margins, capex ($66\u2013$72B in 2025; modeled $70B/$90B), DCF inputs (\u201cWACC of 9.5%\u201d; \u201cterminal growth rate of 3.5%\u201d), and peer benchmarking (capital intensity and multiples). Counterpoints are addressed through a bull/bear framework, regulatory risks, and macro sensitivity, though scenario analysis remains qualitative (\u201chighly sensitive to changes\u201d) without ranges or impacts on valuation/earnings. Actionable implications are present, emphasizing near-term FCF/EPS pressure and potential multiple re-rating as growth decelerates. However, key valuation assumptions lack stress tests and detailed benchmarks, and there is no quantified sensitivity to capex or depreciation. Strongest elements are the mechanism-rich treatment of depreciation and capex intensity; weakest are the absence of numerical scenario ranges and limited validation of WACC/terminal growth. Selected excerpts: \u201cvia accelerated depreciation\u201d; \u201csharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth\u201d; \u201cour EPS forecast of $5.85\u201d; \u201cWACC of 9.5%\u201d; \u201cterminal growth rate of 3.5%\u201d; \u201chighly sensitive to changes\u201d.",
