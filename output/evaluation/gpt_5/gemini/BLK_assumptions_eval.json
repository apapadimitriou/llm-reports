    "summary_reasoning": "Key assumptions are explicit and proximate to the forecasts and valuation sections, with clear units, magnitudes, and horizons (revenue CAGR, margin path, EPS, WACC, terminal growth, SOTP multiples). Specificity is solid: the report provides annual revenue growth rates in a table, margin trajectories to 2029, and point estimates for WACC and terminal growth. However, justification is partial: segment growth rates (e.g., technology and private markets) are described qualitatively (\u201cdouble-digit\u201d) without quantified benchmarks, and valuation inputs (WACC components, terminal growth rationale, SOTP multiples) lack peer-based or source-linked evidence. Internal consistency is mostly clean, though there are minor issues (e.g., stated average revenue growth vs table-implied average; phrasing that calls a higher margin target \u201cconservative\u201d). Crucially, there is no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis on material drivers (growth, margins, WACC, terminal growth, multiples), so assumptions are not stress-tested, triggering a cap at Fair. Overall, assumptions are explicit and specific but weakly justified and not subjected to quantitative sensitivity analysis.",
