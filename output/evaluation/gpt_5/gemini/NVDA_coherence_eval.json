    "reasoning": "The report has a clear structure (Analyst Note \u2192 Business Description \u2192 Strategy/Outlook \u2192 Moat \u2192 Valuation \u2192 Risks \u2192 Capital Allocation \u2192 Financials \u2192 ESG) and a cohesive narrative around the reversal of the China export ban, Blackwell ramp, and CUDA-driven moat. Cross-references are present: the policy shift cited in the Analyst Note feeds into Strategy/Outlook and the valuation model; risks echo geopolitical and customer concentration themes consistent with the thesis. Language is generally clear, and most assumptions tie into the forecast table. However, there are temporal and alignment issues that disrupt coherence. Strategy/Outlook cites management\u2019s Q3 FY26 revenue guidance ($54 billion) that appears to rely on results dated August 27, 2025, after the report date (July 15, 2025), creating a time-inaccuracy. ESG ratings also reference an August 8, 2025 update. Additionally, valuation multiples are inconsistent across sections: Analyst Note says \u201cover 30x,\u201d Fair Value implies 32x, while Bears assert \u201cnearly 40x,\u201d without reconciliation to the base-case. The Financials Snapshot shows a sharp drop in FY25 EPS (2.9) despite very high FY25 operating margin (62.4%) and revenue ($130.5B), which is not explained, raising internal noise. These issues warrant a fair grade under the guardrails, despite otherwise good flow and linkage.",
