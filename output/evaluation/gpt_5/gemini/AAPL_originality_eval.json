    "summary_reasoning": "The report contains several company-specific details but delivers limited original insight. I identified three syntheses: (1) quantifying tariff exposure as ~25% gross downside to valuation, partly offset to ~15% net; (2) linking a services/premium-mix shift to gross margin expansion to ~50% by FY2029; and (3) framing Apple\u2019s $500B U.S. spend as both an offensive AI push and a defensive supply-chain de-risking move. Of these, only the tariff analysis is clearly quantified and decision-relevant with a mechanism; the other two are common framing seen broadly across Apple coverage. Most other points are restatements: incremental impact of Apple Intelligence; assumption of moderating App Store commissions; buybacks supporting EPS; and boilerplate moat sources. The valuation section relies on standard DCF inputs (WACC, terminal growth, generic growth/margin drivers) without novel mechanisms, triggering a cap at Fair. Decision relevance is moderate (some quantified risks and forecasts), but catalysts, timelines, and peer contrasts are sparse. With at least three generic/restated insights and no clear original thesis, the report does not rise to Good.",
