    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all major sections expected in an equity research note, including a clear analyst note, business description, strategy/outlook, bulls/bears, moat, valuation, risks, capital allocation, ESG, appendix, and a lengthy sources list. Valuation is reasonably well linked to operating drivers (NII moderation, loan growth, non-interest revenues, mid-cycle ROTCE, CAPM inputs), and capital allocation is addressed with specific dividend and buyback figures. However, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits core bank-specific KPIs (e.g., NII, NIM, CET1 across periods, provisions/credit costs, ROTCE, efficiency ratio), triggering the KPI hard cap. Peer context is limited (mainly an ESG risk table and high-level market share claims) without robust financial benchmarking. Scenario/sensitivity analysis is absent. Sourcing is extensive but unevenly integrated; several material claims are not explicitly tied in-text to sources. There is some repetition (e.g., \u201cfortress balance sheet,\u201d CET1 15%) across multiple sections with modest added depth. Overall, the report is well-structured and informative, but gaps in sector KPI tables and lack of scenarios constrain comprehensiveness to Fair.",
