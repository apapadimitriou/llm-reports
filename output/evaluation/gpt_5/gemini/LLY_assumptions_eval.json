    "summary_reasoning": "Key DCF inputs are stated near the valuation section and include revenue growth, margin trajectory, terminal growth, and WACC with component details, so explicitness is decent. Specificity is partial: several levers have clear magnitudes and timing (37% 2025 revenue growth; 45% operating margin by 2028; g=3%; WACC=7.3%), but crucial cash-flow items (capex, working capital, D&A, share count) are not quantified, leaving the FCF build opaque. Justification relies on consensus, company guidance, and Morningstar references, but is uneven: margin expansion \u201cconsistent with other analysts\u201d and g=3% lack robust evidence, and the pricing-erosion narrative is not translated into quantified model inputs. Internal consistency has a notable issue: FY2025 revenue of $61.7B is described as consistent with guidance, while guidance is $58\u201361B, creating a contradiction. Sensitivity analysis is mentioned (bull/base/bear varying peak sales and price erosion) but not quantified, so stress-testing quality is qualitative only. Given qualitative sensitivities and one contradiction, the assumptions quality is capped at Fair under the decision rules.",
