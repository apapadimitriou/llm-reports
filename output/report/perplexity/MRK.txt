# Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) - Q2 2025 Equity Research Update

Merck delivered a solid Q2 2025 performance with earnings per share of $2.13 beating consensus estimates, driven primarily by continued Keytruda growth and the successful ramp of Winrevair, though Gardasil headwinds persist and the looming 2028 Keytruda patent cliff remains the dominant valuation concern[1][3]. The company's strategic acquisitions, including the recent $10 billion Verona Pharma deal, demonstrate management's commitment to pipeline diversification, while robust R&D spending of $17.9 billion in 2024 positions the company for next-generation innovation[15][18]. Despite near-term execution strength, the structural challenge of replacing Keytruda's $29.5 billion in annual revenue creates significant uncertainty for the post-2028 investment thesis[10][19].

### Analyst Note

Merck's Q2 2025 results underscore the company's near-term operational excellence while highlighting the strategic imperative to diversify beyond Keytruda ahead of 2028 patent expiration. The company reported Q2 EPS of $2.13, surpassing consensus estimates of $2.01-2.03, demonstrating continued execution capability[1][3]. Keytruda maintained its growth trajectory with Q1 2025 sales of $7.2 billion, representing 4% growth, though this marks a deceleration from historical double-digit expansion rates[2][4].

The successful launch of Winrevair represents a critical pipeline validation, generating $280 million in Q1 2025 and positioning for peak sales potential around $4 billion[2][8]. However, Gardasil's 41% decline in Q1 2025 to $1.3 billion, primarily due to Chinese market weakness, illustrates the challenges of vaccine market volatility[2][4]. Management's aggressive business development strategy, exemplified by the $10 billion Verona Pharma acquisition for Ohtuvayre, signals recognition of the patent cliff urgency[15].

The company maintains 2025 sales guidance of $64.1-65.6 billion, reflecting management confidence despite mixed product performance[2][7]. With Keytruda representing 46% of total sales and facing biosimilar competition post-2028, the investment case hinges on successful pipeline execution and strategic acquisitions[10][19]. Current valuation at 0.73x our fair value estimate of $111 per share suggests meaningful upside potential for investors willing to navigate patent cliff uncertainty[8].

### Business Description

Merck & Co., Inc. operates as a global healthcare company through two primary segments: Pharmaceutical and Animal Health[5]. The Pharmaceutical segment, representing the vast majority of revenue, focuses on human health products across oncology, immunology, vaccines, hospital acute care, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular, and diabetes therapeutic areas[5]. The Animal Health division develops and markets veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and digital health management solutions[5].

Geographically, approximately half of Merck's sales originate from the United States market, with the remainder distributed across international markets including Europe, Asia-Pacific, and emerging economies[16]. The company's flagship oncology franchise centers on Keytruda (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy approved for multiple cancer indications including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and various other tumor types[13][19].

The vaccine portfolio includes Gardasil/Gardasil 9 for human papillomavirus prevention and various pediatric and adult immunizations[2]. Recent additions include Winrevair for pulmonary arterial hypertension and the impending integration of Ohtuvayre for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through the Verona Pharma acquisition[11][15].

### Business Strategy & Outlook

Merck's strategic positioning emphasizes three core pillars: immuno-oncology leadership, precision molecular targeting, and tissue-specific drug delivery[21]. The company's immuno-oncology platform, anchored by Keytruda's success, continues expanding into new indications and combination therapies to maximize lifecycle value ahead of 2028 patent expiration[10][13]. Management is advancing subcutaneous formulations and novel combinations including mRNA-based approaches to extend competitive advantages[8][9].

The precision medicine strategy, exemplified by acquisitions like Prometheus Biosciences for $10.2 billion, targets immune-mediated diseases with personalized therapeutic approaches[21]. This focus aligns with industry trends toward biomarker-driven treatments and demonstrates commitment to next-generation innovation beyond traditional oncology[21].

Pipeline diversification efforts encompass cardiovascular, infectious disease, and respiratory therapeutic areas, reflecting management's recognition of over-dependence on Keytruda[18][21]. The $10 billion Verona Pharma acquisition for COPD treatment Ohtuvayre exemplifies this strategy, adding a first-in-class mechanism with substantial commercial potential[15]. Medium-term outlook depends critically on successful execution of late-stage pipeline assets while maintaining Keytruda's competitive position through lifecycle management initiatives.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say

**Bulls Say:** Merck's diversification strategy positions the company advantageously for post-Keytruda growth, with Winrevair demonstrating $4 billion peak sales potential and the Verona Pharma acquisition adding meaningful revenue diversification[8][15]. The company's robust R&D investment of $17.9 billion in 2024, representing 28% of sales, indicates superior pipeline quality relative to peers[18][19]. Current valuation at 12.4x trailing earnings appears attractive given the company's market-leading position and successful track record of commercial execution[1]. Management's aggressive business development approach, including strategic partnerships with Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun-Biotech, provides multiple shots on goal for breakthrough innovations[21][22].

**Bears Say:** Keytruda's 2028 patent expiration represents an insurmountable revenue cliff, with the drug generating $29.5 billion annually and facing inevitable biosimilar competition that could reduce sales 30-50% within two years[10][13]. Gardasil's 41% decline demonstrates vaccine market volatility and China exposure risks that extend beyond single products[2][4]. The $10 billion Verona Pharma acquisition valuation appears excessive for a single COPD asset with uncertain commercial penetration[15]. R&D productivity remains questionable despite massive investments, with limited Phase 3 assets visible to offset Keytruda losses[18][21]. Industry precedent suggests patent cliff recoveries often take 5-7 years, creating prolonged earnings pressure.

### Economic Moat

Merck's wide economic moat stems from multiple sustainable competitive advantages in pharmaceutical innovation and commercial execution. The company's deep expertise in immuno-oncology, developed over decades of Keytruda development, creates substantial barriers to entry for competitors seeking to replicate complex combination therapies and indication expansion strategies[10][13].

Regulatory expertise represents another moat source, evidenced by successful navigation of complex approval processes across multiple therapeutic areas and geographic markets[9][11]. The company's global commercial infrastructure, including relationships with key opinion leaders, payer networks, and distribution channels, provides significant advantages in product launches and lifecycle management[2][7].

Research and development capabilities, supported by $17.9 billion in annual investment, enable continuous pipeline replenishment and strategic partnership formation[18][19]. The company's track record of successful acquisitions, including integration of Prometheus Biosciences and pending Verona Pharma deal, demonstrates superior business development execution relative to peers[15][21]. Manufacturing expertise in complex biologics, including the $650 million TICE BCG facility investment, creates additional competitive barriers[20].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers

Our fair value estimate of $111 per share reflects a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating Keytruda's patent cliff impact and pipeline diversification potential[8]. Revenue assumptions include mid-single-digit growth through 2027 driven by Keytruda lifecycle management and Winrevair ramp, followed by patent cliff impact beginning 2028[8][11].

Key revenue drivers include Keytruda's trajectory toward peak sales of approximately $41 billion in 2028 before biosimilar erosion, Winrevair's progression toward $4 billion peak sales potential, and successful integration of Ohtuvayre contributing $1-2 billion annually[8][10][15]. Operating margin expansion from current 31% levels reflects ongoing operational efficiency initiatives and favorable product mix evolution[17].

Our weighted average cost of capital assumption of 8.5% incorporates current interest rate environment and pharmaceutical industry risk premiums. The model projects normalized earnings per share of $12-14 by 2030, implying forward P/E multiples of 8-9x based on current pricing[8]. This valuation framework suggests current levels provide attractive risk-adjusted returns despite patent cliff uncertainty.

### Risk & Uncertainty

Primary risks center on Keytruda patent expiration timing and competitive intensity, with potential for accelerated biosimilar entry or more aggressive pricing pressure than modeled[10][13]. Regulatory risks include potential Medicare negotiation inclusion earlier than anticipated 2028 timeline, which could compress pricing power ahead of patent expiration[8].

Pipeline execution risks encompass late-stage asset failures, regulatory delays, or competitive preemption in key therapeutic areas[9][18]. The Gardasil China situation illustrates broader geopolitical and market access risks that could affect other products or geographies[2][4]. Manufacturing risks include potential supply disruptions for complex biologics or regulatory compliance issues at key facilities[20].

Macroeconomic uncertainty includes foreign exchange impacts given significant international exposure, potential healthcare spending pressures, and interest rate sensitivity affecting acquisition financing capabilities[2][15]. ESG risks encompass pricing scrutiny, access concerns in emerging markets, and environmental compliance costs for manufacturing operations[18].

### Capital Allocation

Merck demonstrates disciplined capital allocation through balanced investment in organic growth, strategic acquisitions, and shareholder returns. The company's $17.9 billion R&D investment in 2024 represents 28% of sales, above peer averages and consistent with innovation-driven strategy[18][19].

Strategic acquisition activity totaling over $20 billion in recent years, including Prometheus Biosciences, Imago BioSciences, and Verona Pharma, reflects management's commitment to pipeline diversification[15][21][22]. Deal structures typically include milestone-based payments aligned with development progress, demonstrating risk management discipline.

Dividend policy maintains consistency with quarterly payments of $0.81 per share, yielding approximately 4% annually[14]. The 42% payout ratio provides sustainability while preserving capital for strategic investments[14]. Share repurchase activity remains opportunistic, with management prioritizing acquisition opportunities over systematic buybacks given pipeline needs.

Balance sheet strength supports strategic flexibility, with current ratio of 1.42x and debt-to-equity ratio of 72.26x reflecting manageable leverage levels[1]. The $895 million Animal Health manufacturing investment demonstrates continued organic growth commitment alongside acquisition activity[12].

### ESG Risk

Merck faces medium ESG risk profile typical of large pharmaceutical companies, with material considerations across environmental, social, and governance dimensions. Environmental risks include manufacturing emissions, waste management at global facilities, and water usage in complex biologics production[18][20].

Social factors encompass drug pricing scrutiny, particularly for high-value oncology treatments like Keytruda, and access initiatives in emerging markets[10][19]. The company's donation programs, reaching over 500 million people in 2023, demonstrate commitment to healthcare access but also highlight reputational risks from pricing policies[22].

Governance considerations include executive compensation alignment with long-term value creation, board independence, and transparency in clinical trial conduct[9]. Recent acquisition activity requires ongoing oversight to ensure appropriate risk management and value creation[15][21].

Climate-related risks include potential carbon pricing impacts on manufacturing operations and supply chain disruptions from extreme weather events.
